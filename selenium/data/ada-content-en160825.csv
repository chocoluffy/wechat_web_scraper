Foreigners used to the university summed Sleep, Social, Study three parts, saying only the other three elections, in what is one of only three elections. Obviously proud of you one less. Unfortunately, this is as difficult and foreigners thought. Face reality, you can not do GPA4.0 three communities where the founder has a close friend of body fat rate of 10% also foot three ships. Even if such a person, but also have to give priority to choose their energy distribution in Which careers. As a youth, you are the most precious resource is time, you have to choose. Sleep people do not sleep I'll die you die there is a wireless, life absurd nonsense, of course, surely you still want to live a long time points. Here, we Sleep idea was all about living healthy. The house can not, because you will die. Every year, more college students died, one of my seniors CS Chinese died of heart attack two years ago after staying up late. He said another serious can not be overstated, you'll die, do not seek death, really dead. Adequate rest is necessary, lack of good health, lack of energy you can not achieve anything. new co regularly do some health talks, health centre online say also say, and take the time to look at what to eat what to do it. More than half of what students will suffer from sleep problems, a lot of freshman students to roam the junior haggard face, hairline also move a lot, if the whole person is completely emptied University. Believe me, you definitely do not want to see myself like that. Yes, like a conditioner, he found himself bald is a matter of day suddenly woke up after. You eat breakfast, you have enough time to sleep, you eat salad, you go to the gym. See this article in ten people nine routines confusion, I hope you are lucky man. Study tricky way I totally tried, useless, of course, you can not drop out, it is not to be, not the students did not even turn to the periphery of the college go home. How much class really is not hard, this is not high school admission standards Emaoagou English say agile can come in do you think? You can see most probably struggling in the edge of the drop-out students, it is the same reason: bad studious. Someone born IQ is not enough, I have never met, I met only take this as an excuse to give up. It was not really English, congratulations, you lose yourself in the English-speaking two months everything. Class on time, take notes, do homework after school to go home, you will not be hanging branches. Do not skip class, do not escape even the most simple and boring to fried lesson, you pass a course, but sooner or later this will give you a slap in the face habit. Tricky way all I tried, really no use, a good school will not do it. Students are more than ninety percent before the final began to learn a lesson, which is really bad, advise you for a long time, but I also understand that most people do not listen. Therefore, to cram stay out of each course at least two weeks and make sure they have a full set of notes okay. Investment of time and performance is not proportional to the time required for branch 90 is at least 80 minutes three times. Investment of time and knowledge learned is directly proportional to your body no one take away from this knowledge. Pa learn with you encourage each other. SocialUHIP also reimbursed abortion, please carefully good wholesome social relationships, people must have a few good meals take the child to take the child to travel it. Find work in Canada for a social, summer in someone's home store luggage for a social, drove out to find a friend to play with you but also social, looking for a good character roommate, social is a top priority. You need according to their own goals, to choose their own social channels: Class accosted / community / friends party / street approached / Bar nightclub / Network toxic Chinese circles, repeat, toxic Chinese circle. Many people to Toronto on a deep Chinese no longer able to extricate themselves from this circle, graduate in four years or a dowdy English all day to indulge in various communities within the force to tear each other touted rumors send silly faces. Of course, there are also met with Chinese lap shunned the students, said a few months there was a place to talk to Chinese English to relax is also good, there is no need to exclude altogether, but it is not recommended to mix only the Chinese circle. You can still mix, no way, you are happy. Choose carefully you will want to participate in the Chinese community, how few really good reputation of Chinese society, but also according to the quality of each of leadership changes fluctuate greatly, we will recommend later participated in several own good community, but really not sure. Very carefully choose your friends, what is so big, sucker really a lot more than we want to have a collection sucker could not pick which of the sucker. Werewolf is a good game, throwing a wolf population as well. Enter Tutsi circle is actually very simple, but many people missed the opportunity to start Bale. Dormitory and FLC mode is easy, self-introduction, a lot of participation in public activities, a native English speaker actually do not care how your accent. Beginning university is a window period, foreigners are also just eighteen years of age entered the University of ignorant youth who do not know, a little positive, maybe you will realize what a lifetime friend. No hostel does not matter, take advantage of frosh week and school approached, establish long-term links with facebook. Although many students can not reflect the depth Tutsi friends ingratiate themselves what, in fact, ...... this is still a problem of language. Rare times left school, give yourself a chance to try out of the comfort zone of the bar. Select as many small classes, many well worth a freshman seminar, the students not only easier and conversational, and professors to establish a good friendship with TA is more important, they will be the future of your suppliers in a variety of units letter of recommendation. You just freshman, everything is too late. Give yourself a set a temporary target, and accordingly select Sleep, Study Social balance among the three. Do not tangle too long, you have many chances to adjust changes every two months, to pause and reflect just once. Large university that choice, you can be anyone you want to be, but the price is also extremely precious, you just this once youth time. Do not go with a healthy return for anything, never.

Original 2016-08-04 old assistant and UT UT UT assistant assistant Micro Signal UTzhushou Features UTADA facilitate the public's number is more college students a vision seen ""I, Robot,"" the people will remember the movie depicted human society . It was a robot AI (artificial intelligence) era of highly developed, the robot just like the iPhone has become all consumer goods. They are like servants to obey, they will not let them east to west, they do not want to do all things human to human. Robotics and AI in scientific and technological power of the 21st century was the development, we can imagine such a reality in the near future. We might come before it, think about how will this world's problems, what kind of contradiction. What kind of things to do robot robot has been in existence for many years, they have been around us for our service. Robot meaning of existence there are two: 1, for us to do what we can not do (example: the production of heavy machine) 2, for us to do what we want to do something (for example: a bomb disposal robot) The first meaning no need to repeat we now can not do and will not do. Our evolutionary necessity to keep up with the pace of technological development. And in the future, we need high strength and power engineering, and complex high-speed operation can only be done by a robot go in now, which do not need to tangle. The second meaning is that I believe that robots are very worthy of discussion. What specifically is ""we do not want to do"" something? It seems that we can find some examples, but can not give an accurate definition. Labor, housework, overtime, these looks are what we do not want to do. But this is the absolute right? These things from inherently annoying you? Not really. ""Like"", ""dislike"" is relative. You may feel that learning is painful, but the poor people anxious to take the classroom every day a child (elementary school teacher years old stems). We do not like things only with our favorite things compared, it is not to be liked. Unlimited human desire, we can always find one we prefer to do. From this theory we seem to be derived from a terrible truth: all in all, is a potential we do not want to do. Based on this premise, we can conclude: we need the robot to do, we will be closer to all the things we do. Precisely because of this, it is easy to see the future of human society will be extremely or completely dependent on robots, what we now take for granted, the future will be the wait to throw our robot slaves ""grind."" Mary Ann Warren: Man or personality? So whether the robot into a slave morality, will become the focus of a discussion. To solve this problem, we only need to answer ""Robot count people."" This ""man"" If the physiological significance of the ""people"", and that is certainly not a robot. But on the other hand, daily contact with people we really treat the physiological significance of the ""people"" do. If one day Hawking body completely decay, and his brain was transferred to a culture vessel, and continue the dialogue with us through sophisticated equipment, we still give him all he enjoyed respect and human rights. So we really need to ask is whether the robot will have personality. For personality, modern philosophers Warren gives five characteristics, if have, then this entity can be described as ""personality"": 1: Consciousness (the surrounding environment can react) 2: the ability to think 3 : independent activity 4: ability to communicate 5: consciousness (the ""I"" concept) can say that the robot has more than five traits just a technical problem, will one day happen. Warren's list suggests that ""people"" are not necessarily innate, can be acquired artificial. And when we really have to make a personal machine ""person"" Why should we not given him our equal human rights? When the machine ""who"" have a personality and human rights, we can take for granted that they will be treated as slaves? This will become a major bottleneck in the development of AI. For now, the robot has been done, 2, 3, and 4 of the item, item 5 is a problem. First, the philosophy of the ""consciousness"" is defined as self-examination, and may be different from the surrounding environment and the ability to see themselves as agents. Xiao Bian is to learn philosophy, AI do not know how far from this step. But if it that day comes, we will be stronger AI robots as slaves beck and call is undeniable that the amoral. Under the premise of strong AI Personality = human personality, to enter AI ""human services,"" the instruction will be a brainwashed, and He will never serve someone, in essence, there is a difference? AI development dilemma to break this dilemma is not no way. First, we can deny Warren list, we can argue that the only inherent personality can not be manufactured after tomorrow. It assumed that such rebuttal established Well, this still does not solve any problems. Frightening fact is that strong AI has five qualities Warren on the list, we will be unable to distinguish between AI and people. Examples :( machinery Ji) philosophy famous thought experiment ""Chinese Room"" pointed out the problem. Suppose that a foreigner was locked in a room, which in addition to an English dictionary nothing. When someone outside progressive Chinese note to communicate with him, he can look outside the Chinese dictionary and communicate without problems, and outside Chinese people will never know whether in the end the people inside really understand Chinese. If we can not distinguish between AI and human, then we get the inevitable conclusion, strong AI = people. So far, AI development has encountered a matter of life and death dilemma. Either stagnant or AI will be developed to the extreme, the development of the human personality goes. After strong AI = robots, they also must have the equal human rights of people, and we need them to do the things we do not want to do, they have the right to say ""I do not want to do."" AI engineers lifelong effort devoted to the manufacture of the highest state of AI, and then they can be successful manufacturing mankind. Ironically, they celebrate success, to forget our ancestors do the same thing has been done 200, 000 years.

Yes, it is Artificial Intelligence. The focus of his research is the artificial neural network (Artificial Neural Network). Artificial neural network computing model based on artificial neural networks are inspired by biological neural networks born, its operation mode is different from the logic reasoning calculus. Artificial neural network contains a large number of artificial neurons (nodes), each node has a specific output function (activation function). Connections between nodes like memory, association between two nodes is called a weight (weight). Because each network will output node, the node function and weight varies. Neuroscience students must understand it is not difficult to find a correspondence between Artificial Neural Networks and our nervous system. Artificial neural networks are often optimized by a statistical point of learning, which belongs to one of the machine learning method. - Origin - Over fifty years ago, when Hinton was a high school student when his friends told him this description: the human brain as holographic projection, memories are not stored in the brain of a point, and It is dispersed among the interleaving of neurons from the information network. Probably no one would have thought that just such a chat, but it became ignited Hinton entire scientific career fire. The human brain works with enthusiasm, Hinton in Cambridge and Edinburgh universities to complete their studies. The early 1980's, he has been involved in the young initiated by a computer hardware and software to mimic the human brain jihad. In this area, which we call deep learning (deep learning). Depth study depth study is a branch of machine learning, which is characterized by a high degree of data abstraction through a multi-level process, in 2007, under the Geoffrey Hinton and Ruslan Salakhutdinov impetus has been widespread concern. Now deep learning in computer vision, speech recognition, language processing has been excellent application. - Edge - in Hinton began deep learning research, the running speed of the computer is far less than today. Deep learning research tied hardware conditions at the time received only very limited success, so that the scientific community in this area has been marginalized for a full thirty years. AI community to focus on the quest into the human brain similar behavior shortcuts, few scientists like Hinton, like trying to restore the nervous system through a computer. Study Hinton and several other scientists back-propagation algorithm once briefly cause a Neuroscience Network ""Renaissance"", but interest in it was slowly extinguished. Then until 2004, Hinton published about twenty years back-propagation algorithm, Deep learning still get it deserves attention. Back propagation algorithm (Backpropagation) back-propagation algorithm is an artificial intelligence algorithm to train normally with optimization. Simply put, the purpose of back-propagation algorithm is to find the best match the output and input in a wide range of networks. Unlike simple monolayer of artificial neural systems of different (one input corresponding to one output), multilayer back-propagation algorithm can help the nervous system associated with the input of an abstract concept, which is a linear relationship is differentiation. This algorithm can be described Hinton seeds on artificial intelligence research. - Core - but in this year, Hinton rely on small amounts of money to support Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and other scientists established Neural Computation and Adaptive Perception program. Hinton handpicked members, set up a sophisticated research team composed of scientists, and ultimately change the AI ​​community views on Artificial Neural Network. They studied artificial intelligence network with independent study of nature, without human elements add tags to achieve the learning process, which is called unsupervised learning (unsurpervised learning). A few years later, their achievements starting to get the attention of Internet giants, Google, Baidu, Microsoft, Facebook and so began the development of related products, Deep learning finally became mainstream. ""We ceased to be the lunatic fringe We're now the lunatic core.."" - Geoffrey Hinton now, I am afraid that few people have not heard about voice recognition and face recognition. When you say the command at the mobile phone, and it's like a living as an assistant to complete the character you want, please do not forget to Geoffrey Hinton and his research partners. - Their Stories - Tang Zhong Xian is known to most people is probably because of this Terrier: his son, his brother, his father and even his mother is his nephew the emperor. Geoffrey Hinton is also a number of family members contribute visible. His great-grandfather was the famous British mathematician and philosopher George Boole, the mathematical logic can be described as a pioneer of today's computer science foundation. Another of his great, great grandfather was a surgeon and author James Hinton. James Hinton's son Charles Howard Hinton was a mathematician main four-dimensional space, it is the author of science fiction Scientific Romance. Geoffrey's father, Howard E. Hinton is a profound entomologist, Howard's cousin Joan Hinton is a nuclear physicist, is unique in several Los Alamos National Laboratory (US ""Manhattan Project"" in the design of nuclear weapons one female laboratory) work, she later moved to Beijing China and lived a life of farmers. Joan's brother William Hinton is a sociologist, was the author of works related to the Cultural Revolution. ...... You see here Hinton is a screen full of brush dizzy? Xiao Bian here did not even include all celebrities Hinton family, interested students at your own wiki feel its powerful gene. - Broken language -Geoffrey deep learning Hinton Battle hit for decades, people are in a half, is the moment in science. This few decades, numerous talented and hard as he usually coexist AI scientists will continue to develop to a new height. Decades later, when you and I are old time, AI, how will? For future possibilities, we also look forward to tremble. We are now the lunatic core. Chase was crazy, road is hard, but the end is also unknown, but we can not stop, probably this is the power of science to it.

However, no direction not run chase, trying to give meaning to the word must be. I do not know the point of this article open if you have had with me a similar confusion: the university to learn what? Learning is good what is the use? I was in turn affect the future? We suspect that they have any significance in the school curriculum, even for their own learning states are confused. He participated b2B industry night, after many conversations with alumni, inspired by a lot of small series, so write it down to share with you. Do not put yourself in the narrow path that many people know, is what profession is not important for most of the job, undergraduate learning. After Xiao Bian exchanges and alumni had also come to the same conclusion. These alumni are some achievements in the business world, but their specialty is varied, economics, statistics, psychology, philosophy, physics, architecture, education ...... when you graduated from college took the workplace, most importantly, what would you rather not what your profession Yes. Wherever you stand, your future has unlimited possibilities. Learn lifesci future to engage in scientific research it? CS future can only learn to write code? of course not. How broad your vision, you have a more broad way. So do not limit yourself to the possibility, not because ""it seems to me in the future nothing ah"" and refused immediate opportunities. Do not spend time 'wasted' on learning in any field you want to succeed, a very important thing is to never stop learning. Life may never give us what stage now so as to focus on learning how to learn, but why Xiao Bian, because the significance of our school is actually very easy to learn here Fuzzy take time to say ""waste"" in learning . When the competitive selection, the score is important because it represents your good. So what really matters is not the performance, but the ability to score behind. Every time you summarize, every thought, every analysis, to enhance all aspects of skills, get good grades should only be a by-product of these capabilities. If you learn your energy for a long time are not thinking on the experience to improve the ability, then unfortunately this is actually learning time is largely wasted. Can help you succeed with your life is these abilities, not your back down a point or a knowledge exam score. Find what you love no matter what you do, want to do requires passion, which is commonplace in the chicken soup. The reason I know everything, but you want to find their true love is not so easy. If you do not find this love, try this method. Write down what you like and do not like to do, to think carefully and resistance force behind these things. Even if only some of the little things in life, you are sure to find a deeper meaning behind it. Want to find love, you need experience, more need to think about. A summary and reflection as you can not make sobering insight life, but each time such introspection, is an exploration of their own. What do I want? In addition to this question no one can answer you, but if you do not understand yourself, you can not even answer. Xiao Bian find ways to use resources resources mentioned here, it is mostly refers to the school curriculum, to pay so much tuition, not the best use of how to have too lose. Take the example of writing it, today you are entangled in the essay, but may not think someday you can escape exercise writing skills to help you get a company's interview. Many alumni have mentioned how important writing skills, so if the number of opportunities to exercise your writing skills is not a required course, it will take advantage of elective. For this essential skill, the more good it does not need to get more exercise. Of course in addition to the course, there are a variety of school resources, large internship opportunities, small writing center tutoring once before did not try to be let alone ""did not seem like anything with eggs."" Where you have experienced , have value in exchange with alumni of the course, Xiao Bian found a very interesting phenomenon, that is, of them more than a lot of people read the four-year undergraduate. Many people are learning a profession after a period of time that is not what you want to do and turn professional. But one of them did not feel like a waste of time, no matter what, from your ability to harvest is very valuable, and one step back, if you regret doing something, at least you can get a trial wrong opportunity. Where you have experienced, it has value, so be careful to treat every experience. These experiences certainly far more than learning, community, voluntary, usually interested in, you may never have thought of place for you to open a window. Take for example a social right, life will come to people similar to themselves feel good, maybe you have met with a person you had a similar experience on what activities, and this person will become your partner or mentor workplace even your lifetime friend. Its too entangled in something if it makes sense, we might as well give it meaning with effort. ""Inspirational do more good as a"" following recommendations from b2B industry night Events Colonel faithful share: professional sensation is not suitable for them, do not be afraid to turn losses transferred. (Tracy met a alumni from undergraduate physics has read the Dr., take a long time recognized that he was not suitable for the study, chose to read MBA.) If you want to learn a little more professional, there is no need to tangle, seriously study the immediate course, focused on improving the ability to like. Work study program is a much paid work projects, this is probably the shortest time occupied part-time. Apply for work study program must be persistent, to send a lot of letters to apply for it may eventually get a job. Details visible: cln.utoronto.ca if given the opportunity to participate professor project, if the work-study can be completed in the laboratory of Professor is the best. How ranked so high, and why? Because from the perspective of academic research is, how much does have advantages. Find project you are interested in, to research, write a letter to the professor. Likewise, you may send a few dozen e-mails, but only a few people respond, even possible that all applications have been fruitless. But even so, you can still treat it as a job search exercises. Another benefit is that you participate in the project will be very professors know you, you'll get from them is very valuable recommendation. Record their course work. If your time is limited, you put the focus on the most interesting on the professor's class (if you performed well in this class), while as much as possible to communicate with these professors (at least to let professors know your name) . We need letters of recommendation when you send these records collated professor. this point is very important. Participate in a variety of activities to get to know the students, seniors, alumni and professors. Most people are willing to share their experiences, even though we often say that my honey of thy arsenic, but in most cases you can learn something from them. It is also an opportunity to establish contacts, and feel can ask to talk to their business cards. Follow up to develop the habit of writing, if possible within 24 hours after the event message to the people you know people at the event, thanked them, mention your conversation, which is very important for building relationships. When try to select some elective courses to cultivate skills. For example, writing classes, experimental classes (for lifesci want to do research students), maybe you're not good at these courses, but the less good at the more to strengthen, not to be the three-letter limit GPA learning direction. (But of course, a high GPA is to prove your ability to learn, and this is definitely helpful.) If you can not meet on one, you can choose to participate in some workshop, or book writing center's appointment, writing center guidance are very experience, in addition to other than your essay according to proposed amendments, they will give a more macro recommendations. To develop the habit of reflection summary, the idea to write down. For example, as mentioned above, usually you can write your own likes and dislikes do, to summarize their essential characteristics. The above is the summary of a few small series, thank you have the patience to read, including immature place also please bear with me. We are not in order to complete their studies and learn a few years time this university is preparing for the future. After graduation years recall the time now, I hope we can meet to say how much of that in a few years, the value of. Because Final approaching, this week and next week will be suspended UTevents update. Xiao Bian here wish you all the best exam!

Small as we bring a professional math elective. Freshman wide variety of mathematics courses did not let you get confused, do not know where to start? Cipian Course Guide from pure science coefficient Meng Meng da God Jessie write, Mio Azusa sauce assists, introduce each level is similar to the contents of different difficulty freshman mathematics curriculum. Xiao Bian first warning about: Please consider carefully according to their own situation, not suitable for pure number of people hard on difficult subjects as causes hair loss, balding, find a girlfriend and other issues. Definition of theoretical mathematics papers pure number of rather vague, opening the calendar look, you can find Mathematics and Applied Mathematics freshman courses are required level of pure numbers: MAT157, MAT240 + students MAT247 Mathematics Department has a kind of arrogance bones, especially the pure number, as if living in the top disciplines despise chain. But this science is not the legendary cold so high, especially for the students experienced the college entrance examination, is fully capable of easily second child freshman math class. (For such students, if you have not take the 4.0, I just want to ask:?? LOL what extent girlfriend found yet) Keke ...... that far away, then explain in detail these doors Instrumental lessons: MAT157 Analysis this math course very well known, and why? It is similar to a school bully label, basically everyone asked:???!! ""You learn what math class ah University mat157 mat135 mat137 ...... wow !! Pa (bow down to $ # @ & * % ...) ""this course is similar to the domestic mathematics"" mathematical analysis ""(blue textbook), but through observation, much simpler mat157. The basic content is the theoretical proof version of the calculus. There's nothing calculated, in this regard even as mat137. The lectures rhythm is moderate, but a lot of work, but as long as careful completion of the exam is not an issue. Several test and final painting style stable, very little biased questions, but still need some mathematical literacy bonus (and there are many hidden bonus, so the possibility of this course is not a small explosion points) Professor Prof. Bierstone is a highly intelligent, affable, popular super grandfather. (When the end of class, I heard students longest, enthusiastic applause) and writing on the blackboard is very clear, not to school to find someone to look at notes can handle (this is wrong, do not imitate) the entire user experience is very good ~ so many advantages, so in the end this course Difficulties? My personal experience: the final exam a few questions really need to shake clever to do it. So, if there is one up on the recommendation mat157 seniors, please do not take him away at once, or you can make friends ~~ MAT240 Algebra I to me to learn a lot mat157 bon voyage and unhindered beginning God kneel on this course. The reason is probably linear algebra is no contact before the new knowledge, it is necessary to abandon the stereotype to create a new body of knowledge. And proofs based, difficult to adapt to so many people. mat240 is considered a very ""culture"" of a course back to the various theorems inference lot, very theory (compared to mat223). To sum up: This is a little mathematical ability plus moderately hard effort can learn a lesson. For students willing to spend time, get high marks is not difficult, but very clever but I do not for endorsement, mat157 can get a higher score. A Monday post jobs still a lot ...... often see some students handed forty-five dense text pages are all proof. Exams very very very close to the textbooks and coursework, good review, 4.0 no problem, really (smiling face .jpg) M professor writing on the blackboard is not clear except God Prof.Kudla really no faults. Class, looking at him Tuosai feel very happy (Wulian) ah ... ... Kudla relatively divergent ideas, but as long as hearing and vision good enough, get him talking about live content, you will find he is a very interesting people, and the linear algebra speak lively and emotional, inspired by the one - you'll love this door! MAT247 Algebra II is also interesting mat247 still a lot of things to be back some difficulty, and added some computing applications. Class rhythm faster, require high concentration of attention. If you happen to choose a lot of classes next semester, and at the same time falling several course schedule, catch up together pretty cool acid (Do not ask how I know) is still Professor Meng Meng da Prof.Kudla, the difference is .... .. Speed ​​faster, more chaotic writing on the blackboard (crying) you want to learn this course, self-important (the crowd: which course self-important?!) even though the content of the class can not catch a hundred percent, you can also back home ah!

Come, let's talk about how to attack (zuo) slightly (si): First of all, if you get on the AP calculus AB / BC, then congratulations! - And there is no egg with ...... because there is no proof of the AP. Therefore, it is good when it comes to the classroom professor, of course, preferred Alfonso. Blackboard with the same clear thinking, and GPA4.0 joke as funny ... ...

(Tracy: Hello everyone, this is a serious course selection guide) Last welfare: taylor's online notes is still quite useful, recommended the review / preview when using ~ MAT 223 Linear Algebra seem to be recognized as the ""most water freshman math class,"" and the course looks like it worthy of the title (note the ""seemingly""), a total of two term test. test1's average remained at 67%. (All: Ha ha ha Conscience water courses!) But after test2 everything is different: 48% of the average once led directly to students and teachers spray each other - everybody: Give me curve! Uppal: I will not! And I guarantee that the final exam will not be easier than test2! (Although the final curve or 6%) work hard, in fact, mainly because of the defeat test2 habit of doing the calculations of proof is not good, and are not familiar with the definition, are not familiar with the definition, are not familiar with the definition! (Important words three times!) Therefore, we must clarify the concept before the exam, the best on paper at the definition of dictation. But, well, after all, do not call them water courses, learn routines (fast take a small book in mind good!): 1 to go to class? Answer: it does not matter. Never go to school to learn to get 90 + Pa Jun abound, the key to control of their learning (not really advise you skip class) to go to class, then recommend Uppal big lesson, sold out games, so go ahead occupy positions ~ 2.

As you complete each chapter title the back of the book with all the answers again brush, brush a wave of past test exam is a very wise behavior ~ (I have a friend perseverance emperor, before the final brush anger a dozen of past exam, then test very good !!) 4. Hey exam chaos? A: You must ah! Our great teacher Alfonso had before the test message to all students: Do not reviewed, out of chaos Hey! The recent study at Harvard University, also said chaos exam Hey crazy people than exam review people managed to get 23.3%. The study also said that if the exam crazy loop Girigiri love ...... (Well this is my fabricated .. now I made do not go on ......) but still worth recommending relaxation exam of! MAT 224 Linear Algebra II Congratulations, you found a real - most water freshman math class (not mat223 oh) Course code seems clear from this is Mat223 advanced version ... but you are too naive in fact, not so much! It is an advanced version, as it is rebuilt again 223 together with some additional material more appropriate number. 224 and 223 are then what difference does it make? 1. prove more focused. 80% of the basic exam questions are proof ... 2 Go lecture becomes very necessary. Partly because ""textbook is more difficult to understand"" it (although I believe that 224 is well written but also cheap and affordable as long as 30 knife) 3 No weekly quiz, and replaced by a weekly online assignment4. High points ! Usually median has more than 75% ... (tips: weekly tutorial problems is very useful, because about 40% of the exam questions are tutorial problems of the original title yo !!) in the year to reduce the difficulty Oh 5 (joyous crowd clapping. cheering) in summary ... mat224, and, like its brother mat223 it is a rare conscience water class too! Just read carefully, a good brush title (weekly tutorial problems and past tests), GPA4.0 not a dream! ""Mathematics is a language"", that is Barbara right. Most people just want to use mathematics as a springboard, after the turn to finance, computer science, actuarial and so on.

Toronto's most popular government has closed (that how to do it, anxious face) students can go to this website to find their clubzone nightlife of course also go directly to what I said that a few blocks , Which watching people line up many more beautiful it directly into the general entrance fee is required, according to the good or bad wherever he goes in the knife 10 to plus infinity range (in fact, no more than three fifty knives) , paid their admission reading id (19-year-old threshold can be most ignorant freshman boys were shut out, Yao Ming face) can go inside the dance floor rocking, thirsty or would like a cup of sister wine needs to go to the bar, the general price is not very cheap, but not outrageous, met South Korean initiative to strike up a lie to drink and proactively Dunzou sister after she finished and practice English, do not imagine something and then go buy her drink, the final result must be natural and eggs. sister who want to find the best bars, then a trusted male friend (or stout female friend), accompanied, one can experience the metamorphosis together yelling for help, so the chance to get relief will be much larger, and second in his unconscious when his own home and do not have to carry alone alone a taxi. Be sure to remember the girls do not go to nightclubs alone a person, really very safe. But inside the club can meet all kinds of strange kinds of people, small series have encountered no small group of young white man after drunk aunt came over and asked the phone number, then also attempted to be chasing, really scared dead baby, it is estimated that relatively dim light, and then compare their eyes blind now. Nightclubs games: here to tell you about our club in general or the opening of several small popping kick play this game 1. Puff is the most famous and most common small game, Pirates of the Caribbean and there was even a bragging scene (Section will Turner and two on the octopus captain flying Dutchman to play the dice game, gambling on board servitude time) per five dice, we could not see each other dice, if two people play that most ten can be called the same number of points, for example, I called 10 4, they do not believe that he can ask to open up to see if the two dice add up to 10 4 that he would lose to drink, if not 10 4 months that I lose my drink (one that can be done any number, but if the start was called 1, then 1 can not only be changed before 1,1 wild special effects are not picking, called off after 1 pick is called) a lot of people can play with up to three people, then you can call the same 15 points, 4 person is 20, and so on 2. fifteen twenty per Guessing Game two hands, add up to two people 20, each of the two sides did not (make a fist with both hands stretched out as not), 5 (hand fist hand straight 5), 10 (10 straight hands) of these three numbers, while a newspaper than their hands out large digital or the same number, if the two sides out of the figures add up to its own newspaper, and that win. If you do not have that but not reported, and that if the other party does not, you win. And if you do not have a newspaper does not, the other a few newspaper a few, the other to win. Great hands together short rule is equal to the sum of the two sides which side of his mouth to shout, which side would win. If the parties do not add up equal both hands either side of his mouth to shout, which is no winning or losing, continue to guess. 3. bitch licensing a group of people playing the game, a poker to remove the king, each card has its own skills, everyone Mopai, followed by launch brand effect, Tricky effect max, laugh effect max, atmosphere Here in turn attach upgrade max respective licensing right to use special effects 4. World War a group of people to elect two leader, two stone scissors cloth, a first-round decision to drink liquor and wine types, the second-round decision teammates, win We can always choose teammates, a total of five people, if you lose more than a dozen possible IV. . . . Then singled squad inside elect people across the during singled free to choose the game, may be bragging, can fifteen XX may Stud, or simply rudely than the size, if the opposite annihilated everyone need to drink out of the first round decides kinds of wine and liquor. This game should be carefully selected teammate, small pigs had been foaming at the mouth 5. The air bombing teammate Xiao Bian play this game quite a long time did not know the name, and then I took a private name for this game is called bombing, a global dice, then six cups respectively six sided dice, players shake if a resolution to 1,1 cup is empty it can according to their own feelings of the day you want to join the kinds of wine (may be white water, drinks, etc., in order not to pit themselves) and liquor (this time a man needs to stay a good line in the future meet maybe drink this wine is their own), after the completion of the transfer of the dice to the next person, should shake to the liquid inside the cup, then no matter what it needs to drink (Tracy tried agave drink Chivas + + nastea composed unknown liquid ..aka sauce soup), and then re-roll the dice, if corresponding to the number of cups and there was something that you must continue to drink until you shake to the point corresponding to the inside the cup is empty so far, then you need to add what you want the liquid to the cup, this game is very easy for a person cleared n cups, drinker this game is not fun to be careful. When snapped open play can play the game very much, because of space reasons other similar games King, Truth or Dare, like bad street Stud no longer see them here, a lot of games described above can play with them, too you can use your own dice and poker detached invent your game. Finally, give you a little tips, lcbo closed early Oh, I remember before the start popping kick bought enough wine oh three: shisha (this part is small series of personal opinion and personal experience, do not represent the position of assistant, without any data and documentation support) from Arab hookah a pass over tobacco products, cigarettes and different classes, hookah personal feeling is a serious diluted and then added to a variety of strange spices tobacco products category. Different from ordinary cigarettes, smoke shisha when required set of equipment, there is not much need to buy their own, and in downtown finch has a small bar there will be a lot of shisha supply. First shisha can choose what you want of taste, there will be a lot of amazing flavors such as watermelon, honey, vanilla, etc., you can also choose semi-detached (and then the eggs). Suction time, users need to put on top of the tobacco burning charcoal to help tobacco burning. Bottom pumping cigarette box filled with water above the filled tobacco. Emit smoke of burning tobacco through water filtration, and then through a straw to smoking hookah. Hookah itself is no taste, only you choose the kind of spice, and the dangers of hookah also been discussing the personal feeling extremely extremely low hookah nicotine, pumping up the feeling really is sucked in a smoke and then spit it out. . . . Really very, very boring. . . . . . A bottle can smoke a hookah afternoon, but I really have not seen really a bottle of shisha smoke so long, they are generally Exhausting while chatting and then felt silly to pay to leave, hookah Generally this kind of thing say or do to chat snapped open when the power play, to a small bar inside the barrel price is around 10-30 shisha knife, forcing grid and decoration Kandian level, taking into account its natural features and eggs, really is a bit cheaper, but sometimes there will be miraculous loading force hookah Another function is to mix drinks with marijuana and use, greatly accelerates this really is not recommended for anyone using marijuana and such, and for each person to use tobacco products resistance different, try the egg carefully: Striptease (skip if you do not like, please do not report little helper ~ ~) for each boy in Toronto after arriving more or less heard some rumors about striptease, after each eaton shopping was finished to eat Korean village or five guys when after the Zanzibar (359 young st) will shy avoided. Xiao Bian would have been such a shy little boy, nineteen years old until the year pushed by friends that wonderful place. Toronto is actually a relatively open city for all of this stuff is also not as secretive country, arrived in Toronto friends may feel a striptease bar open in the cbd city center and is the most conspicuous sign incomparably may that we have a certain influence on the city, in fact, Toronto does not care. It is understood that striptease bar in yonge street, a large segment etobicoke around below shows the most famous zanzibar very little of it which are generally small or young Asian visit, in general, are middle-aged and small Indian curry brother majority (ever seen a curry with a little brother to visit his girlfriend, and just five body cast), sometimes there are lesbian to come along for the ride (really a magical world). First, as usual, the security will check your id, 19 years old bye. Then you can find a place to enjoy the beauty, in general, in accordance with international practice will be called two bottles of Corona (about 20 knives), then enjoy a quiet (and not) weekend. Because the strip bar inside, as a curious Asian guy, you will be dancers sisters preferential treatment, which is not the same nightclubs and bars, countless model wearing bikini blonde body will flock to the waves to ask you before you want to go upstairs and jump together a private dance. Later stage on the part of private dance and strip for fear of being in harmony and purity up to assistant image has omitted 195 words. If you want to see it can be intimate little helper. . . . Finally, I hope this can give you special kick snapped a disservice. If we like it might be even a second of the third period, which will include more extensive play instead of this post written much of the party type, such as where you can play with real guns shooting, where you can fly an airplane (non-small single-engine helicopter), where you can bungee jumping, how fishing, what procedures, etc., horse riding, archery, or if you have any good idea or experience you want to teach and to be sent to little helper ~ Contact us: If you want to contribute, please send mail to be forwarded only after authors@uoftada.com If you want to reprint our original text graphic message, please leave a message to the background, to give permission.

""we go on the road will not explode."" ""small potatoes isis lackeys! traitor country!"" even once a number of public rumor went out the ""armed police arrested a homemade bomb in dundas terrorists blabla"" false news Toronto Paris accompanied by a picture, even in Canada there is no armed not think about. And like this, still inspired fear for your heart, crazy turn out 10w + hits. Calm down a little, read through these comments, is not some unsightly places? A petitioner scrutiny refugees, refugee reception pause we all know the end of all of a sudden received 25,000 refugees are too late, not to mention the review, the resettlement work after the landing are enough to choke. It now appears that Justin Tredeau indicate the reception of refugees is the attitude of most people's actual landing time should be later than the end of the year. It does not matter, we are anxious to review the refugees as long as possible, it is best to review the end of time, but then again, how the trial? What trial? Most of the refugees in Canada received directly from the three major refugee camps in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, the United Nations has registered it again, Canada will again conduct a survey and immigration interview. ISIS majority of the members are persons with Syrian or Iraqi nationality, they applied for refugee passport identification readily available, and even fraud effort are saved. Unless his hand a full detailed list of ISIS does not exist, what kind of review to be able to filter out the dangerous elements from the ordinary refugees? Do you want to sign and return home before the entry pressing teach guarantee? Or turn dark room severely pressed half life details? In this case even before the simple people, they have forced the terrorist point of the bar. From the outset, there are only two options: to receive refugees or rejected. Two, ISIS will mix Immigration If ISIS plans to use this channel, then mixed with refugees terrorists are inevitable feasible among the refugees. The problem is that they need it? Canada has more than one million Muslim population, you really want to launch terrorist attacks, then, than the elite members lurking in the refugee camp a few months waiting to be drawn (low probability) in Canada and will be subject to extra attention and action limited by the background check after landing direct the development of a few zealous jihad through social networks is not a simple native Muslims how? Paris attackers event more than half of all French and Belgian citizens only found a refugee passport has not been confirmed with the attackers for being suspected ISIS counsels. If you really want to terrorist attacks, denial of refugees will not improve any security. Third, the ""Muslims are dangerous, walking on the road will explode."" Islam is the world's second largest religion in the world there are 1.6 billion Muslims, extremists in the Middle East now toss one per cent it? Muslim accelerate secularization is the best defense against the spread of extremist ideas, if each Muslims are extremists, the surface of this planet is almost emptied early. ""Chinese people are very dangerous, saw the dog eat."" ""Indians are very dangerous, and saw a woman on rape."" In this way the group a bad Case radiation to the entire group unified discrimination really good? An important factor in life, education, vision, income, family, Which is not affected. Toronto is also reside overseas migration, ask yourself, will certainly outstanding quality Chinese it? Canada is a nation of immigrants, a respect for the equal multicultural environment for Chinese hurt. Canadians with enthusiasm accepted your Chinese chamber and authoritarian circumstances, accepted the Chinese city filled with dirty and can not read the recipe, to be the most basic respect at all kinds of cultural conflict. And you, in turn, the refugees began to discrimination. This is something people do it? Today, support for racial / religious discrimination against a group, there is no guarantee that tomorrow discrimination does not fall to them. Fourth, ""I spent so much money to move over, what freeloader refugees."" Guess up to two years before Canada's refugee reception which country? Chinese immigrants to the country's future prosperity, refugees in a humanitarian helping hand to the less fortunate. Why do not pay money from the refugees? People are being killed! ! ! Were massacred! ! ! People of the country to war! ! ! To the dead! ! ! Millions of dead that! ! ! People's home blown up! ! ! Classes not on! ! ! Go get a bullet to hide! ! ! You do not because of the threat of immediate death before seeking asylum in Canada, and you are seeking a better life. The country accommodate two types of people, no one thought would be a class of another type of exclusion. Speak really good, eating hot pot singing, who leave their homes to a language barrier cold northern drudge live ah, is not troubled by the intimidation. Perhaps because of unrest in the past for too long and too cruel, many of us think of people in refugee, compassion and compassion never touch the moment, we go on the ice benefit formula calculated. Hopefully, when we are in trouble, someone will lend a helping hand. Fifth, Canada White Lady of heart left, to the time the cocoon Country RepTrak @ 2015 rankings, the reputation of Canada is the best country on the planet. From 57 years of the famous Pearson Peace Prize began, Canadian-led or participated in every UN peacekeeping operations, providing billions in loans to developing countries, is the initiator of multiple international organizations and conventions and active participation By. All along, all Canadian international humanitarian benchmark for many displaced people with their homes. Average received more than 200,000 immigrants each year, tens of thousands of refugees, is one of the world's most multicultural and tolerant. This is the pride of this country. The people here suffering of others who are not indifferent. In the short term, the reception of refugees inevitably bring economic pressure, social security unrest, lack of national identity. Although this is in exchange for eliminating the need for a large order would have to be used for front-line combat military aircraft, but take the same number of places for refugees to receive migrants, the Government is facing controversy is much smaller, and the benefits derived will get more many. Not just the Chinese circle, circle Westerners as controversial. Whether the money spent on the fight against the terrorist organization or directly on remedial, not to eliminate the root causes of the disaster only passively receive refugees really good? By saving money is really enough to make up for the loss of refugees into Canada may bring it? Only this time, whether students or immigrants, the entire Chinese population seems to be overwhelmingly more realistic stand there. Since this world is that some moderate religious than other religions, some groups than other groups of high quality, some lives more valuable than other lives. Why in vain to pursue equality? The pursuit of political correctness? Because even on the surface of the warm moral disdain to do, then this world would not be really good. Canada is not from today began receiving refugees from Ireland to the victims in the Philippines, Vietnam, from Uganda to the victims of the war, and even our fellow citizens, have a place in this country. Now you come here, clamoring jungle justice, denial has been the world's only cruel enough warmth. Muslim hurt civilizational values? Really challenge Canadian values, fishes are of you, right? Canadians are no longer mind it? No, they are not only a long head, but also long-hearted. One day, they can tell their children how to be magnanimous to be a person of integrity.

But the ""self-reliance"" sometimes give the world a devastating blow, which is why? This is nationalism dominated by hatred. When nationalism as wounding razor historical similarity 1918 Seventy years ago, a once owned the whole of Europe with the military and national power comparable to the nation, now only cede territory in humiliation after the defeat, reparations. A politician in front of the crowd at the moment of publication of impassioned speeches. He will spearhead the powers, accusing their insolence and greed led to the decline of their country. Now this nation to stand up, to recapture lost, but also more. He lit a long deep nationalism, he triggered the Second World War became the largest in the history of human slaughter. This person is called Adolf Hitler. Germany after the defeat of Germany after World War I World War failed to withstand the 132 billion marks (330 million dollars) huge war reparations, inflation, and high-speed change three times a day. Like Nietzsche said, people do not hate suffering, disgust is unnecessary suffering. Germans feel that they have suffered a great wrong, after all, a tango, a German war not want a fight. In this historical background, the hearts of the German people filled with hate, just waiting for someone to ignite. After Hitler came to power, out of control, driven German national priorities, as well as anti-Semitic anti-Gypsy policy. The German was an urgent need to rehabilitate someone out for them, and find out the cause of their suffering is now the culprit. Hate to unite a nation of the most efficient means, so under the guidance of Adolf Hitler, the entire German nation began the persecution of the Jews. First, a large number of Jews were deported out of Germany, but this does not match with the German occupation of foreign territory desperately policy because expulsion will immediately be designated to be in their own territory. No other way, only the system of slaughter. How easy it is to all his problems point to a both abstract and figurative ""Jew"" on. No need to consider further, just know that they are sinners, for various historical reasons we are going to resist, destroy them all. The persecution is called Holocaust (Greek meaning ""full burn""), led to the six million Jews were killed, almost half of the world's Jewish population at the time. Today, the massacre are still not washed away the remains. 2013 when Xiao Bian visited Auschwitz, which has seen two large reservoirs, do not look as white, which is why I asked the tour guide replied: That is ashes. Today nationalism 2016 there was a talk show host tells been famously nationalism will only make you as something you never even knew some of the people are not proud of their achievements, as well as hatred. Yes ah, let hatred of a people forget that he's starving, forget that he is the leader of a dictator, and even forget that he sit on the sidelines in an ancient no massacre. Hitler then hatred pattern today is still built in, even on our side. Since the end of 2015, US business people Donald Trump alone, ""the supremacy of the United States"" remarks, all the way to break the hurdles will be, eventually won the Republican presidential nomination. Many people are asking, how he got here? Actually very simple, we need to look at recent American history. In the decades after World War II, the country urgently needed to boost the productivity of the economy. That is if you are a white man, and not stupid not disabled, will be able to find a job, and could live a good time, at least a car a house and a wife. Such a state until the 1960s. Affirmative action broke the American with a wide range of potential naked white supremacist system. After the era of Martin Luther King, blacks and other minorities get a variety of compensation. A social resources are limited, when a group of people get a little more, another part will naturally get less. Precisely because of this, compared with more opportunities and resources continue to be the minority whites had traditional strengths slowly disappeared. An accounting job had two whites competition, there are two white two black, and one Asian competition together. In this way, those family was not particularly favorable, education is not high on the white felt robbed by the unfair treatment. Trump took advantage of the lower middle class American whites this psychology. He told them that in fact, you have been owed, you present all the others are immigrants took. Once quiet and peaceful Muslims have been broken. These poor whites has always wanted to say someone finally said it. Ah, all those alien wrong, as long as they have a good day we'll be knocked off. This is the Trump portrayed utopia. Although funny, even though logic is not fluent, he indeed touched the white American nationalism which with nerves. 2016 Nationalism positive energy nationalism is not inherently evil. One's own country have deep feelings nothing wrong, after all, people need to find a sense of belonging to animals. A Chinese man wherever he will be holding chopsticks to eat a bowl of white rice, which is a cultural gene, no one could get to go too. But love does not mean to deny their own nation to other nations. Not your death is my death the era we have been behind them. The international community needs of the 21st century is not abuse and exclusive needed is calm thinking and rational debate. Mahatma Gandhi led India in the 20th century independence movement is an excellent example of positive nationalism. After hundreds of years of alien colonization after Gandhi advocated not fierce resistance, but moderate non-violent, non-cooperation. No matter how the British colonists Jifengzhouyu like to suppress the movement, Gandhi always greeted with a smile. This is not only the ultimate political campaign was a success, Gandhi's ""non-violent, non-cooperation"" has become a worldwide symbol of peaceful protest. Some people say while watching the Olympics this joke: "". America really take advantage of what race they have a"" This is an inclusive force. Inclusiveness is not just tolerated, more mining house long, perfect their incomplete. Conclusion positive nationalism does not mean to let others trample their own, but instead sought to achieve self-reliance in the premise of respecting other peoples.

What about pey, cs and friends are more interested in the project, can you tell us about the difficulty of applying it? There quota it? K God: the degree of difficulty I can not give a definite answer, based on experience over the years and my personal data is easier (calm face), there is no quota restrictions. Tracy: So what have GPA not ask for it? K God: Gpa not required. (Tracy:?! Nani) there have been examples of gpa2.0 people find jobs. Anyway, I think they have a glance at the report card on what did not ask. (GPA no limit really is good news Ohe Oh ...) Tracy: What can be learned in the pey? Schools teach knowledge can hold live it? Assignment inside the school and how are you feeling K compared to God:? Pey learned greatly depending on differences in work is not very good summary.

(Tracy: ADA forced placement in time ... you and God code so what, and quickly added to the development of several multi-ADA personal project) Tracy: Are you ready for school will have an impact and stress during the interview? K God: the impact is there, because it takes time to research the company and do some stock of knowledge of academic interest is bound to fall a bit, then need to wear a suit during the interview, it is possible to wear a suit to go to class or doing lab (in fact, will be handsome).

Tracy: Well K God, in several aspects of the general interview? If the middle should have technical questions not fully answered or answered correctly, whether there will be a significant impact? K God: The first interview usually does not involve technology, mainly personal information and intentions, as well as communication skills study. The second round I was purely technical interview, I have a problem not answer them, I feel the impact is not large, the main thing is to see the way of thinking of it. (It seems there is a problem out there is no answer or no answer good and not too tangled nervous oh ~) Tracy: When the level of work colleagues how, will not have pressure? K God: a high level of co-workers are also low, but I think the most important thing is the company's integration into society, because writing program is a collaborative process, a good relationship with colleagues will be easier. There is also pressure when the main beginning to worry about doing well, but adapted quickly gone. Tracy: Do you think your boss / colleagues expect you compare what kind of skills or abilities K God: I am the boss of my expectations and other full-time employees is the same, independently responsible for the program, to the customer cross. So my first day at work, just start writing code. However, according to IBM's say, where they started mainly meetings and training, training finished and then began to dry. Tracy: As mentioned the need to integrate into the circle as soon as possible, so usually you will want to do anything to integrate into the corporate environment and interpersonal circle as soon as possible?

K God: Gpa To be honest I think, and not associated with looking for work, no one mentioned my transcript (Anyway, I burst points).

Congratulations 2T0 of mentees second year tuition is expected to break 50,000 mark. (Tracy: these words are not multi-size partner wants to say), after all, a decent sister (I think some people want alas?) So I have to return to the topic RC Offer happy to receive it.? I think that they have to give the RC have monkeys that? However, the truth is that in the first year is not considered officially entered the RC, RC only meet the freshman curriculum and meet all the requirements to score in the second year to enter the profession. Does not meet the requirements, it can be rebuilt in the summer school vacation. (Distressed those who buy tickets early, but only due to the rehabilitation of children left behind, so they tell us that tragedy is better (bu) Good (yao) Science (tai) Xi (lang)) have to mention is how much famous piece :. ""a person to buy a Hermes bag, I can only say that he is wealthy in general, but if the man reported two big summer credit courses, and I have to say that he is really rich,"" you understand . Then introduce the Rotman freshman Basic Course ECO100Y (Introduction to Economics) ECO100 into micro-economic (micro) and macro (macro), is divided into two semesters. ECO100 this course is to develop the most crucial ability to understand knowledge. Suggest that you want to keep (wo) to (cai) good (bu) Good (xin) of (ni) Xi (tin) used (ne ~), after-school day combing the knowledge of classroom learning (men) Xi (hui), do not wait until the re-examination to learn to think, when the time will probably like this: RC RC students must enroll into their ECO SECTIONS. (Speak truth, can not grab the other, forget it) last year, three professors were Pesando, Benjamin and Jessica. Each professor has their own teaching style, the volume is also very different. PesandoPesando deserved the best education teacher, 17-year-old Harvard prodigy course is famous for deep intuition. 15 years of teaching experience, teaching clearly organized, always feel benefit in his class. The most serious lesson of his class is also my sister on no one. In his class requires diligent notes (her friends because he learned to comfortably also quite powerful), and the class he also humorous, very interesting. I've seen the least rate of skipped school classroom professor. There was a sister school seniors and we say Pesando class will be relatively harder, roll-out routines are slightly different topic each year. But to be fair I think Pesando examination paper easy to use, personal feel his annual examination paper and past test are similar, are routine, he mastered the routine you're 666, did not grasp the routine, do not panic, summer met. Jessica If Pesando is a volume full of routine professor, I can only say that when it comes to Jessica her roots! this! No! set! road! There are many school brother school girl Jessica asked me how. Dialogue as follows: - sister sister, Jessica professor how about you? - Renmei good heart. - The truth of it? - Renmei. Jessica is the new ECO lecturer, PhD student. May also experience problems, Jessica lectures far compared with Pesando and Benjamin. PPT is basically a book Uehara sentence reading lectures basic content on the PPT. The papers, she had a girl's mind -A- exam is always a variety of background stories too! Theme novel, lively content, only you can not do without her unexpected. But to be fair, though a weird question, but does not Chaogang. Pesando the papers, if they work hard brush problem, and to some understanding, score is not difficult. But Jessica's question papers rely solely on the brush is of no use, we need a thorough understanding of a thorough grasp of the concept. (Because she did not routine ah) attach a photo Jessica United States. ECO is also a professor Benjamin Benjamin, director of the department of economics. Because I did not attend his classes, so consult the RC University Pa Redknapp. ""Good man, clearly lectures, slides clear, in stark contrast with Jessica, the question is not black but did not start so simple. Handsome, for a suit every day,"" (alas, this year enrollment depends on the teacher's face? ) MAT compulsory MAT133Y1 / MAT135H1 + MAT136H1 / MAT137Y1 / MAT157Y1 Oh, one out of four (possibly your life last math class a math class) MAT133RC mathematics camp. MAT133 is a soft girl, but she is on the slag slag does not mean (ah good dirt ///) but have to say for the RC, the 133 is a math curriculum for the RC, is a suitable choice. Professor Tate, then recommend domineering grandmother. Writing on the blackboard clearly, the whole notes and amiable. Attach the famous Tate grandmother lesson: MAT135 + MAT136 calculation, calculation or calculations. For RC students, this course may be some underachievement. Unlike mat133 about financial mathematics, unlike mat137 we lay the foundation for some of the science major. So if the RC for students, personal feel not very recommended 135,136. MAT137 proof or proof. For major actuarial, statistics and the like-minded can choose this course. MAT157 pure mathematics. Suffice it to say, if you have the courage to choose this lesson, you come to RC doing? RSM100H / RSM100Y This course is an Introduction to Management. It covers three specialists (finance, accounting, management) all the basics that can be selected after the RC. This course is no trick, everything is all syllabus content class book +. Before teaching are respectively the upper and lower two semesters each year by the two professors. The first semester by Professor John, more boring lectures, skipped high rate, low average. Responsible for the second semester by Khan (folk called him Khan) is very active in his class, he was able to learn a lot of lessons. The professor is extremely lazy, the volume and past test is almost the same (to change the title to change the name change is not the full range) so the clubs are relatively high. However, this year has finally change course, the sister school seniors do not really envious of. Sister suggestions, energy in the first half (rsm100H) then do not the previous year (RSM100Y) recommended course is the last year before the new changes, we recommended courses. Originally selected in the second year of the course to the new freshman students can choose. They are RSM219H1, RSM230H1 and RSM250H1RSM219H1: Introductionto Financial Accounting This course is compulsory RC. In high school student over the accounting of relatively little advantage. But I have not been on accounting and not too worried about the children, showing a certain sister studied accounting ""big advantage is not where to go.""

Like winter after New Year's respect is so quiet, no need to celebrate, only the arrival of spring in the foreseeable future to look forward to. Toronto already accustomed to this routine, every year is not to endure the cold after a while it? However, for a certain group of people, this type of depression brings more pain - restaurant owners against poor turnover frequently frown: ""You do not come to eat, I eat what you want?"" So in order to save the off-season, Toronto Special Events Office call 35 restaurants together launched a food festival project, the official version is called ""to showcase Toronto's diverse and unique fine dining restaurants"". Translates to ""What? You do not eat too cold in winter? I'll give you cheap packages you coming?"" This marketing tool, we now call ""buy."" You should also remember that in 2003, SARS has just began to subside, although far less than the Chinese Canadian epidemic seriously, but enough to cause SARS impact on its tourism. So planning Food Festival and as part of the recovery of the tourism industry in Toronto has been a greater government support. Summerlicious and Winterlicious two annual food festival so fire up, and continue to grow and develop continues to this day. (Photo courtesy of Il Fornello) 2009 in addition to the definition of the new specification originated in 2003, another important food festival history was 2009, the year. Prior to 2009, the restaurant food festival participation is based on a third party and Customer Evaluation and Review (the so-called public comment) to decide, from 2009 onwards, will participate in the Food Festival restaurant filing, and the staff of the Special Events Department the good number of rigid selection criteria in accordance with regulations. This process is somewhat similar to students applying to university, it was mentioned on the network in 2009, the restaurant selection has taken a vague invitation only, presumably still a subjective component. Nevertheless, in this year, participation winterlicious restaurant has expanded to more than 150. (Screenshot from the City of Toronto official website) praise and controversy exist undeniable, Winterlicious and Summerlicious two food festival is indeed a great success. In the food and beverage industry should be the most depressed time, the major effort will reach the restaurant but usually twice as City of Toronto wish that this project can bring economic benefits, but also make food culture in Toronto to get publicity. For the majority of the goods to eat it, licious is a great opportunity to enjoy fresh food, usually too expensive restaurants within two weeks of the offer price affordable 3 course fixed price menu, popular restaurant in the open booking first full day is also not surprising things. (The picture shows the most popular restaurants Canoe Winterlicious Chef John Horne), however the saying goes, there must be a black powder, Winterlicious and Summerlicious very successful in many ways, but this is a lot of activity in the face of controversy. Licious not able to participate in the activities of the restaurant complained that his own post was hit by so many government tax take to promote their competitors, participate in the activities of the restaurant will face double the usual operating pressure, and in order to reduce some of the costs have to weight and quality to make certain sacrifices that many restaurant waiter said his workload doubled during licious, not even half the usual appreciation and gratitude are not. Customers also complained that some services are not in place, the food is not as good as daily, overpriced drinks and other issues. Meanwhile, Winterlicious many restaurants are relatively high-end restaurant, weekdays diners are more elegant manner, there will be some customers are not used during the winterlicious not comply with dining etiquette, more or less affect the dining experience of other customers. Criticism of Ye Hao, Ye Hao look, winterlicious 2016 in the eye closer and closer. This year's number of restaurants expanded to two hundred, of which only one is clearly divided into Chinese food restaurant for 15 years to join Paul Food Festival Luckee mind, chef Susur Lee will combine traditional Chinese and French cuisine, the pursuit of innovation and tradition coexist Cooking aesthetics. North American restaurant exists more or less westernized and more advanced southern cuisine restaurant in general to the main, Luckee no exception. Xiao Bian as Northerners do not expect to find much taste of home in this restaurant, but I hope to represent Chinese Luckee its outstanding performance in the Winterlicious. (The figure from Luckee official website) So what to eat this year? History will stop here, let's look at the highly anticipated crowd together several restaurants. (Tracy did not personally tasted the restaurant, the restaurant is based on the following google, yelp, tripadvisor and other sites score Featured out for your reference) Canoe [Canadian] that no parts winterlicious list ignores Canoe, located in the TD tower 54 layer, belonging to Oliver and Bonacini food empire. Bannock [Canadian] (2014 winterlicious Bannock Pictured on the main meal of pork and chips) is still Oliver and Bonacini's restaurant, the price is a lot more than Canoe People belonging to lunch 18 dinner package 25 grades, the main Canadian comfort food. Rosewater [Modern] an elegant and romantic restaurant cuisine belongs to contemporary, from the view menu is a fusion of different national dishes. Insomnia [comfort food] Insomnia cuisine as comfort food (homemade food), the price is most close to the people of a file, but the score is much higher than a lot of fine dining restaurants. Brunch Lunch recipe biased in favor of style, dinner recipes is Hamburg, Shepherd's pie, fried chicken category. Michael's on Simcoe [Italian; Steakhouse] steakhouse with a little Italian style, the price is high only 45 dinner knives, but for meat animals is still a very good choice. Pukka [Indian] known as the Toronto-wide best Indian food on the menu you can see the classic butter chicken, vegetable curry and so on. Momofuku Daisho & Momofuku noodle bar [Asian] Momofuku not the traditional meal of the day, but there are some American style in Japan and South Korea mash. Daisho higher price, lower-priced noodle bar.

Straight to the point, in the past few years, I have actually been looking for a way of life, there is hope that a person can tell me how to live. To what good grades, participate in dragon boat team basketball team, he wanted to enter into a number of communities, many of my friends, there is a beautiful girlfriend. In appearance, like everything, you can fly with happiness. However, I know that he flies very bad, every day from the future endless stress and anxiety, there is no time and effort to accompany anyone. I can not find the reason, can not solve the problem, I think this is the life I chose. So, then she left. A way of life now tell you a story. The story is a bit long, the story is a microcosm of life, a lot of people, I hope that after listening to this story, you can let the new semester is about to come be thinking. This is a story of those who kept on the run, the protagonist called Mr.X. Mr.X since primary school onwards began to work hard, you can not lose at the starting line, so the big people are told he said. After six years of hard work, he entered the city's best junior high school, and that he was destined to get into the junior high school, he did. He was very happy, he was happy for two weeks. Because now he has to start thinking that the city's best high schools, and only those who entered the university the most Diao on the high school have a chance. So he desperately efforts in junior high school, he did not how to enjoy the process so hard, but he told himself: I went into the universities in the country's most Diao, to pay all the time will be rewarded by that time I will happy. And six years of suffering, he did, he received a heavy letters, and he did, not so big so happy. Then the next two months in summer, his carefree daze, peace of mind to travel and enjoy their results. Then he entered the university, happy two weeks. Pressure again, the university more competitive, he found that each person actually related to themselves as hard, so he must work harder, because he wants to get his dream job. Then he got in the freshman summer, when the share of internship opportunities, then the pressure appeared ... he had relaxed, and happy too, but these are easily the time after the end of the exam. But each time, as pressure reappeared, he did not understand why he was not happy, because it was all he wanted, but he has got everything he wanted before, and then he said: Yes, as long as I get the job, it will be better. So he continued efforts to continue to make their resume more handsome and more sexy, he was a member of three communities, two of which served as the Chairman, on 6 courses per semester. why? Because the survival of the fittest, no pain, no gain, if you are slacking off now after waiting regret it, his teeth, endured all the way. Finally, he got the job, he was happy silly. This is what he really wanted, he succeeded. He entered the company, everyone else is top university graduate, he could not believe the fate of such blessing himself, he felt his peak in the world. He was pleased for a week. Two weeks later, he found the school's pressure and the pressure can not be compared, he never leisurely time with friends and eat in the cafeteria, he works 80-90 hours a week, he did not enjoy. However, he told himself, would be good, he will do well, if he did come to this house the company's partner when he did not need to worry about the. He continued efforts, worked hard, he did not like his job, but said to myself: Just a little more effort, to endure a little pain, then there will truly be the ultimate reward of. Hard five years later, he did, he became a partner, the company's youngest partner. His music was crazy, direct repair of a holiday, this time he has married, bought a villa in the suburbs, luxury cars, he felt at the top of the cloud. This life lasted three months. Because he is now only a junior partner, he thought about becoming a senior partner thing? is it possible? Well, only strive to achieve, because not many people can climb the pyramid in this position, increasingly steep slope, the road more difficult. But he will succeed, he struggled, endured, not interesting, but he put up, he succeeded! No pain no gain. This time, he bought a more expensive house just for a holiday, as well as a new car, bigger, faster. Then he said, I was finally, finally able to relax. Then he began to relax, relax for two and a half months. He fell into a quagmire pressure. Because he was just a senior partner, managing director, however, only one, only one, think that position is almost impossible, but he determined he could, he has been a star of the figure, there is no reason to give up here. No fun at all, he did not spend much time with his loved ones together, almost missed his son lives in all the most important moments, with his wife's relationship drifted apart, the family rarely eat together, and because the family eat a waste of time, you can help him to become managing director thing? Great course, to accompany customers to eat it. Because there is anxiety in his mind, he climbs high enough, he had to prove himself. He said to himself: Finally a brook, so I went to become a managing director, I can get the ultimate happiness. A full seven years, in seven years the material has an absolute abundance, all the time not just a lack of time. He continued to struggle and struggle, and finally, he succeeded, the Board issued a statement, he boarded the Wall Street Journal front-page news, Xiao Ming became the managing director of this legendary company. He was extremely proud of, he is happy, he is happy for some time, then anxiety again ... One day, he walked into the office, sitting in a chair, feet resting on the table, after all, he is now the boss. He looked back to see Central Park, very beautiful, and now he is really, really stood the pinnacle of the world. Then, someone knocked on the door, knock on the door, he was startled, because the general secretary will come to him to inform him, most people could not come, after all, he is now at the pinnacle of the world. He opened the door to the people is Chairman of the Board. They were greeting each other, then Chairman said: This year's profit is incredible, doing good, impeccable. We are all proud of you, thank you for your presence. However, you should retire, you have a 72. This is the life of those who kept on the run, this is my dream life before, in the best case. Of course, this is only the general outline, but emphatically describes several special stages, not entirely so. Overall, however, it is kept on the run 'lives. Rat Racer, focus only from point A to point B, and then easily two weeks to a month, and then point B becomes the new A point, then this cycle, round and round, like a continued to climb roll mice. I had always been wrong in the past, I feel happy year struggle 11 months is to last month's kind of relief; Pinmingdiwang climb for a few years is to climb to the summit the moment list of small hills sense of accomplishment. That was my 10 years of life, there is no pain, no gain, fish and bear's paw can not have both, success and happiness as you can only choose. I only live in the future, tell yourself: Final finished the can relax, and that time everything will be it. Really is a big mistake. At the time I was Mr.X shadow, it is in a cage constantly running up mice. My best outcome is to repeat Mr.X that life. A lifetime of torment suffered stress, lack of time is a lifetime, a lifetime do not know what Pinmingdiwang climb, life just live for the future, in order to prove alive and really enjoy the moment when it is briefly from A to B above, then B has changed into a, he began a period of pressure being oppressed, being ruthless time of day, and so on, until you can no longer climbing the mountain, retired. How to do that? You mean I do not have goals no ambition? no. For a world-class university of us so we do not have the target is not equal to the ambitions of our lives. Another life and this life opposition, the pursuit of excellence is an attitude towards life. Both are wanted from point A to point B, the difference is: the former only has eyes for B, in his eyes is a straight line from A to B, B not reached before he can not stop to eat with his family, only to reach a B to qualify; the pursuit of excellence and a man who kept on the run with the point of view may be exactly the same, but it is the inherent nature of different, they have the same ambitions, may be greater, they work equally hard from the outside, they will pursue as a goal, the same way they have ups and downs in life, but they also enjoy the chase process. This is the difference between excellence and kept on the run and the most essential: they target the same desire, but they also enjoy the process. To the university, you can pay a lot of friends of the opposite sex better, after all, opposites attract, a group of Friends of the base is not to feel like that, you can also find a woman destined pots friends, learn to think when it is all fun. You still hard to learn, but you can enjoy this positive feeling, you can satisfy each of two hours 15 minutes on the strategic and repair, you can relax the body meditation for 15 minutes, or simply listening to their most like small apples for 15 minutes, or dinner with friends and simply chat. Weekly day off to put yourself, do what you want to do, yes, the examination is not over, but you need to restore, you need to invest, you to enjoy this day. Then you find that Monday, Wow, I feel the whole body is full of electricity, you really learn to High, doing the title, and then two hours later, give yourself the right to relax, give the opportunity to breathe on his own, give her a call yourself to say "" I miss you, ""the opportunity to help the family to give yourself a wash bowl, drag a land of opportunity. Then you continue for a High pursue their goals. Enjoy how no one qualified to teach you, these are the choices, of course, can make these choices is not easy, because the need is to change your thinking change, and most importantly, act. Is not the end, but rather the journey It's not about the destination, it's about the journey. ""Live not for the battle won, live not for the end of the song, live for the along."" Rat Racer regardless of how long to run , climb high, he may stand in the peak of the world, see it is their inner infinite empty, apart from the height of Language, nothing. Then he looked up, oh, can not stay, there is a higher slope to climb, and then were told: We thank you for your presence, but you have retired, you have a 72. Thank you very much have the patience to see here. Live not for the battle won, live not for the end of the song, live for the alone. We treasure our school to see.

Unfortunately, many people are on the Canadian political system is not a correct and comprehensive understanding. Today, old and with our in-depth understanding of Canada's political system, installed X home learning essential knowledge! Since the separation of powers Montesquieu proposed legislative, judicial, administrative and political ideas in separate 1748, the separation of powers was immediately regarded as a fundamental rule of the Western democracies. Canada, too, the legislature, the courts, and administrative systems fragmented, contain each other. Due to the administrative and enforcement simply from legislation, today we explore the main Canadian legislative body, which is usually said that the ""government."" democracy? It is not majority rule? Many people have been attracted to Canada's democratic system in this country, but for ""democracy"" but this thing is not too understanding. Canada is not the so-called modern democracy one vote, majority rule. Such democracy is called direct democracy (direct democracy), in addition to modern Western countries will not direct democracy in a referendum, because such a system can only bring mob rule (tyranny of the majority) that the majority of people deprived of their minority s right. For example, in ancient Greece, parliamentary democracy that the decision by Socrates ""poisoning the youth thought,"" he would impose the death penalty. To avoid such confusion really ""tyranny,"" Canadian representative democracy (representative democracy), that is, one person, one vote to elect a constituency Members Members represent the interests of the people of the constituency in the House of Commons (House of Representatives) government, through the new law. Such a democratic system can ensure a bottom-up administration. A law passed by Members must meet the interests of the people He has chosen. In other words, under such a system, what your mother think you're not too cold, only you say your mom will go to cold you find clothes. Mr relationship with the ruling party has a membership of each of the Members of political parties, elected after the election largest party in the House of Representatives the most seats, it becomes the ruling party, the opposition has become more second, the third party is soy sauce (Oh no, this is my fabricated). Canada has three major political parties: The Liberal Party (Liberal Party, which is now the ruling party), The Conservative Party (the Tories, now opposition), as well as New Democratic Party, referred to as the NDP (New Democratic Party, the party now soy sauce ). Each political party will elect a leader, and the Prime Minister is the leader of the ruling party in Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Prime Minister is not elected by the people, the people's right to choose only the ruling party. Xiao Bian himself in 2015 general elections, when voting for the first time, and did not write Trudeau or Harper's name on the ballot, but only when all MPs in this constituency. In addition to the appointment of judges outside the Cabinet, the Prime Minister is not directly driven by the power of policy, the prime minister's powers be limited to the support of the Party Members. I think that the Prime Minister is very powerful because he represents his party launched the policy, even though the policy is not him. A variety of ""small potatoes disastrous"" articles like circle of friends turn, small potatoes said, ""I have a disastrous power? I do not know how?."" Government legislation to do just one thing every day, legislation. Initially, a bill will be presented to a Members, such as ""how much from free tuition bill."" ""Multi-Free Learning"" will begin after the bill was presented three readings (audit) in the House, and the full Parliament will debate whether this period should be heated through to learn more Free Act. If the final vote, the bill will be more free to learn on the Senate handed (senate). Canada has a very difficult senators and two sacred duties: paychecks, waiting to die. Since the Senate is appointed by the Prime Minister himself, rather than democratically elected (yes, that is hand-picked the meaning), they do not play any role for the bill. Free Learn more here in the bill is to take a process, then it will be submitted on behalf of the Queen of England in Canada: the Governor's hands. The Governor is a rubber stamp, it was delivered into his hands the bill he must sign an agreement, otherwise it is considered resigned. Governor after signing his words, learn more Free bill would become law, and more college students happy Big Dipper Ben. The legitimacy of the Government of Canada Government of Canada to give its legitimacy, the people of the votes from two sources, the support and the Queen. Democratically elected ruling party a natural legitimacy, because it represents the interests of the people, if not, then it will not be elected. It gets the vote can be seen as the people's mandate, so it has a natural legitimacy. Queen of England nominally the head of state of Canada, through Canada every law she must agree to pass. Although the Queen and there is no real power, but in name, she is a symbol of Canada, as well as every Canadian monarch. At the time of naturalization, you must swear allegiance to the Queen. As for why the queen had such a high position, probably because the long Meng it. A stable government in general, the composition of the Government of Canada from the people of the country begins. People who they think can represent the interests of its own Members, and then put forward by him in the House and by the law. Law adopted by the administrative bodies, the interpretation by the judiciary. Such representative, parliamentary democracy both to ensure the smooth functioning of democracy, but also by the people to ensure that the policy is not about non-professional politicians.

I will do a thing until the last minute before the start. I also learned to use ultra-efficient late to make up for the delay, anyway, I finally I can always finish it before the deadline! But I know my problem lies in: When I sit down to work, I was always the first to do a number of other irrelevant things. I call this state called light delay, probably you, too, it has the following ""symptoms"": sit down and start working before, always used first on the microblogging or browse other fun sites; always told myself that before the start there let yourself relax time of 10 minutes; there will always be those who do the trivial and less important things, such as check email, and so on. Finally, I have given this type behavior: sitting at the table, the general will really start working for half an hour or an hour later. Once I really started, you will find nothing to make me distracted, will finish the work. I began to realize either a blog or write code, I will follow this pattern of behavior. Once I put five minutes, we have been able to concentrate on work done. So the law was born 15 minutes I decided to do a little experiment. The next time I started working, unlike the usual force yourself to do a similar check mail as trivial things, but by the following steps: 1. elect their own to do a proper business (which makes you very clearly clear goals) 2. put all the interference terms are switched off for 15 minutes, do not let them bother you at this time 3. no interference without interruption down to business after 15 minutes 4.15 minutes, if I can not hold on, I'll give up or to do other things and as a result, then I threaded to work for 15 minutes, I certainly would not want to stop. Even those things that I had no power, and immersed in 15 minutes, I have become willing to complete it. Just read the book the first few chapters, you will gradually immigrants and would like to also read the later chapters. I also tried other methods to get rid of delays to improve efficiency, which to me is not so useful. For me, there are several questions: 1. they are too complicated, and requires 100% invested (entry which can be really high) 2 they generally emphasize the efficiency of ah, ah task priority, not that specific process 3. they always assume that people are the kind of person to be able to sit down and start to concentrate on the work (and it is difficult for me) I was kind of keen and respected time management people, those recommendations really good, but it Not suitable for me. My daily life schedule fact, many projects are identified, I can understand almost every hour of every day I do things. In this case, my problem is not to pick on me to do something, but how to do things efficiently and without delay. The above method is very similar to my Pomodoro Technique. I had a little heart contradict it, because they feel they can not afford to focus so long (25 minutes), so I shorten the time period, compressed into 15 minutes. Why does this method work? I think the main reason is because it let me have a positive momentum. That is when you do a post attached to 15 minutes, it is difficult to change to other roads. Focus is also the core of the 15 minute rule. Distracted if that is the nature of people, just like you're reading this article probably halfway will switch to another tab to see something else. So I forced myself to only a certain period of time focused on a single thing that would distract the little flame snuffed. In short this method allows me to focus, not interfere with other things. And it will not let me have too much pressure, I only know that I work for 15 minutes, without giving too much progress to set their own requirements. How to use this method to turn off all the other things in front of the interference, for example, turn off the independent tabs or turn off the phone. 2. Turn off the interference is not enough, you have to allow yourself to concentrate on 3. hands immediately, do not think too much. I also want to know ""do"" part, but when you think about thoughts would drift anywhere. You can write directly to a first draft, but not too much in order, and then a follow-up version of a version iterate. 4. If you think you can hardly started working, then you can brainstorm instead of ""hands."" But it must be written in the form of ideas or draw mind maps, not only in brain activity. 5. If after 15 minutes you can not stand, then give up. Take a break and come back.

Amassing perhaps the only sister with the cow when I wanted to blow up Heaven: ah, that stems where I see coming forward? But it took great pains are found. This time you need to POCKET + EVERNOTE summarizing your knowledge fragmentation. Principle fragmentation of knowledge refers to a certain learning time division (such as weekly LEC) and then to learn the knowledge, but these pieces of knowledge often has one downside is that people become narrow thinking, you say in the LEC We know the relationship between the ABC to be drawn according to DE inherent logic of the three. But you can not get the ABCDE F-slave relationship, because of the inherent logic DE You do not understand. For example, we face proofs math class, but also for example, is ESSAY internal relations, we may all have a ""reason I know all that, but I just do not know what special ah"" feeling when. Today's presentation is through POCKET + EVERNOTE method, in the process of summarizing the information to associate himself had knowledge. The idea is: in a variety of SNS, consultation platform for information choose your favorite synchronized POCKET POCKET spare time again in reading, and to determine their knowledge of their usefulness, and then choose whether to sync to EVERNOTE (complete secondary filtration, the garbage removed) POCKET synchronized to EVERNOTE choose to use IFTTT regularly EVERNOTE in the notes to read, and connected on Pocket TAG, etc. by adding a knowledge point directly from the browser or Twitter, Flipboard, Pulse and Zite and other 1500 multiple applications will be articles, anything might like to save the video to Pocket; subsequent offline reading app on multiple platforms (browser IOS / Android / Kobo / under any platform). Pocket installation and use are very convenient, how to open a key save to function after the installation is complete there will be Instruction.

Install link bubble and set default browser, choose to open the letter in the micro browser, and then drag it to the top left pocket, to complete synchronization. Evernote Evernote on the famous Chinese name called Evernote. A cross-platform sync notes, save the information documenting software. By Evernote, you can write about travel, record class notes, shopping lists, to establish their own TO DO LIST, teamwork, and most importantly, you can Evernote for your class notes and fragmentation of knowledge systems consolidation induction.

Next to the small series of personal habits to be examples: small series according to their usage, the notebook is divided into five categories: 0 - InBox, representatives from the pocket sync to Evernote's some information, such as the above screenshot Jin Yong novel about women analysis of the Lord. Or maybe just some still in progress, or has just completed the notes, for example, is written in this introductory article. These articles will be read after every once in again in Evernote, and to add the TAG and to the appropriate notebook. eg., the article after finishing the second time will be summarized in daily. 1 -? Idea &, on behalf of some of his spare time to think of some fragmentary ideas, accumulated through a period of consolidation after induction. eg., in the bathroom or perhaps in the subway when I wanted what sort of gift to his girlfriend preparation. 2 - ToDo, this is very easy to understand, To Do List to establish the place, so what's to DUE, so what to buy buy buy, so what to do can create To Do List here. 3 - school, as the name implies, is the school's lecture notes, classified according to the course. 4 - Daily, a record of books, travel, and so on some of the daily chores. About TAG in Evernote collate surgery where, TAG is a very important part. As shown above, I would add a different class based on the content of each lesson on the different TAG, for example Daoist Taoist and so on. Benefits TAG TAG is made with a different classroom content associate. For chestnuts, small liberal arts monk as omnivores, respectively, in HIS, EAS, PHL above classes have met with Taoism, Confucianism themed lecture.

Light look st.george campus research building stands in many life science department will know how much it how high degree of attention, and improve laboratory equipment can definitely make you happy to enjoy a variety of experiments. Closer to home, life science freshman had a lot of basic courses, covering many areas of expertise, including BIO120 + BIO130, CHM138 +139 (16-17 school year onwards to CHM135 + 136) or CHM151, MAT135 +136 and PHY131 +132. Life science various professional courses for both physics and mathematics requirements vary, some may require only two optionally a detailed information, please refer Curriculum requirements u of t calendar given. Below, I will introduce you to these core subjects according to their own learning experience. Chemical CHM138 (16-17 school year to CHM136): Introductory Organic Chemistry This course is taught mainly organic chemistry, including the structure and reactivity of organic matter content is more complex abstractions, is the test of the students' perspective thinking. Thus, many new concepts rely on school professors Speed ​​fast thorough explanation is difficult to understand. But, fortunately, it is used textbooks CHM138 very powerful, plus a detailed explanation of the text with map image will be able to help you understand these abstract concepts. Therefore, I suggest that you here before each lecture briefly preview the content of this lesson again, this class does not like to listen to listen to the bible as a professor lectures. The study focuses on organic chemistry grasp the changing of the law, therefore, after-school summary is also essential, so as to clearly grasp the laws of structure and reactions. CHM139 (16-17 school year to CHM135): Physical Principle main content of this course is a chemical reaction in the physical principles, including the reaction rate, energy conversion, and so on, but many formulas are well understood. Since most of the formulas and constants are given in the exam, so there is not much need to remember the content, as long as they master the usage of each formula, the examination will not encounter too much trouble. This course involves a lot of calculation problems, so the data substitution, unit conversion and so need to be careful. Because of the difficulty of this course is significantly lower in organic chemistry, so a lot of sister school seniors have chosen the first semester on 139. Based on this increasingly common phenomenon, what year it was decided to code in Physical chemistry Organic chemistry before, so do not need to reverse the order music.brothers class. CHM151: Chemistry: the molecular scienceCHM151 is a year-round classes, mainly to provide basic course on the chemistry of the people, but last year I found a lot of students want to go biochemistry chose this course. Comparison 138/139, this course is more difficult class content, a wider range, but the content of the examination was relatively simple, the main challenge is the understanding of knowledge and the ability to draw inferences rather than memory capacity, so if there is to Chemistry is very interested, want to challenge the juniors could also consider freshman choose this basic course. Chemical experiments and quiz chemistry class has two quiz, a test in the tutorial, the subject is very simple, just read the textbook can do it (151 quiz will be on course community). The experiment in the quiz is to test the general lab manual The above experiment on the principles and procedures, and sometimes the title will be a very fine, very carefully the students need to prep lab manual. Experimental procedures are generally explained very clearly, as long as the step by step to make sure you can successfully complete the experiment. Finally he stressed that the chemistry experiment pre-lab and lab report must be carefully written yo, the lab report points is still very serious, we must be very careful to explain organized. Biological BIO120: Adaptation and Biodiversity Since this course is focused on understanding the principles of biological evolution and phenomena, it will look very much like the liberal arts curriculum. To understand the difficulty of the course content is not high, but wide knowledge, so the class can not let any details of the professor speak. Usually there will be a lot of reading, reading in any of the content are likely to appear in the examination. But personally think that this course is focusing on understanding, no need to remember all the force of knowledge, as long as the master and the fundamental laws of biological evolution and the concepts involved in the examination of the contents have not seen even in the face also it can be inferred out. But then, each exam will BIO120 biased Jidao particularly special topics, such as the vertical axis of a graph, like what lecture on what is mentioned, everyone doing the past test will know. . . So I suggest, the examination time do not stuck on a problem stalled, really I have no idea if they silently turn to the next question, then finish all the questions back to think of this question. BIO130: Molecular and cell biology if the high school had biology12, then 130 pairs of you, some of the relatively relaxed. Although there are still a lot of content need to read and remember, but as long as the reading are carefully read, in class professors emphasize knowledge carefully recorded, and when the test can be substantially bon voyage. BIO130 early classes and evening classes are not a professor post (BIO120 by the same professor taught early and evening classes), so a lot of people will go to rub teach better Prof.Yip evening classes, often a packed classroom , many students even stood behind lectures. Of course, do not rub on my friends, do not worry, just listen carefully in class, the same can learn. Biological experiments and quiz biological experiment with respect to the chemical may be less pressure, because the operation itself does not account for points, and does not require the completion of each experiment, a lab report, so doing it will feel a lot of fun, of course, often there will be no draw any useful data. Biological experiments in the quiz is also very simple, as long as careful prep lab manual can be successfully completed. BIO120 and BIO130 every door there is a very complex research project, the need to complete their own access to information, experimental design, analysis of the results. However, only one each semester, you can thoroughly enjoy this unique time of writing any of it! Mathematics MAT135 / 136 Calculus135 / 136 is a relatively basic mathematics in the two classes, with calculation and application-oriented, so for high school calculus over the Chinese people, this is quite easy to get the two points. According to last year's situation, 135/136 to drive down average, tend to last out of a very difficult subject in the term test, the class only a few people can write the correct answer, so much want to get in on these two courses high points, but also very difficult. Professor of mathematics which is the most popular Pro. Lam. He is both the course of the volume of people, for the class notes very well, everyone says that basically looked at his notes do not read. Of course, the most important thing is to learn to do mathematics problems, questions textbook, past test title should brush! MAT137 Calculus If you are very interested in mathematics, you can also choose 137 or 157. Because life science, select 157 is substantially not, and small compile is 137, so there is not a 157 highlighted. 137 with respect to the 135/136, the biggest difference is related to the more proof, so difficult than high school calculus to be larger. Here recommend Pro. Alfonso's class, he is also a roll of 137 people, lectures very conditioning, interpretation is very clear. Because Pro. Alfonso is a great personality of the professor, his lectures and ideas and are often the opposite of years, so in order to review his notes are based on the textbook, textbook supplement. Examination of moderate difficulty 137, in front of a few calculations or algebraic problem usually is not difficult, the difficulty is the concept behind the questions and proofs. However, examples of proof of concept and as long as the professor talked about class understanding thorough examination will not be baffled. Similarly, learning to brush 137 or title, alfonso open Society distributed to you on a textbook he recommended exercises you can do, because often ignored, so here is strongly recommended that you before the test can be done at the corresponding chapter title, although some large amount, but only to see many more questions to respond Pro. Alfonso protean exams. Physics PHY131 / 132: Introduction to Physics these two very basic physics lesson content, in addition to the beginning of the wave 132 may be a little challenging, other similar content and high school physics, the question is even simpler, so that friends can watching very simple circuit diagram on paper, while their GPA Imagine how this course is pulled. If does not have any interest in physics, I still do not recommend choose either subject, because there is not much new knowledge can learn. Or a very good physical and interested friends, it is strongly recommended PHY151 / 152 either subject, which involves proof, the formula is more complicated, and even talked about special relativity yo! Above it is the basis of life science freshman class, but because you want to join in the BR, Xiao Bian here can also recommend some elective courses, such as PSY100 Introductory Psychology (BR2), SOC102 Introduction to Sociology (BR3), etc. Elective do small series believe it depends on personal interest, because much of anhydrous lesson! Even these electives are also very difficult to get high scores, no interest, then it would be more difficult to learn. Many life science friends want to go after the pharmaceutical aspects of development, it will be freshman elective one PCL102 The Act of Drug Discovery, learn about the process and the future of the Canadian pharmaceutical pharmaceutical development prospects. About learning, I think the most important thing is summed up. Before the examination of important knowledge, formulas, and the kinds of questions often arise sort, so as to better mastered, so that all the test sites are strung together in a line in the mind rather than the mess piled up in there. Not usually encountered in the content but also timely to ask professors or classmates, otherwise it will seriously affect the understanding of knowledge points behind. Exam review should as soon as possible, a week in advance is necessary to arrange the review plan, do not cram! Above it is my introduction to the life science freshman learning, we want to help, and finally here I wish you good health, all wishes come true! He Qiuyu Katherine Xiao Bian want to again thank the last big sister Katherine theological super careful course selection guide ~ life sci sister so well, give me a chant! Another sister Lifesci, but also last year lifesci elective Raiders (UT assistant newborn Raiders freshman life science basic course), author of the forthcoming want for our little friends into the pit of Lifesci put another piece of advice: Lifesci basic course more and specialized targeted, many students may be selected Lifesci base class, there is no longer consider adding some other professional foundation lesson. But if you do not want to go Lifesci good road, sister I suggest you try to expand their elective direction, more opportunities for trial and error and correction.

He has like a peacock's large library (RB); has comparable Lanxiang indoor site (GB); theater has the same classroom (BT); has a larger than regular football field lawn ...... If a school only to him environmental score, the score is certainly not much lower. But ...... Gradually, I open it completely changed ...... ROSI time to see the new semester invoice when ... - started crying this wallet! In Canada says Tyrant, I first thought is certainly Vancouver. But I say to you, you still too young, local tyrants are much ah! According to official data, how much local tuition $ 6,010 - 10,460 a year (a lie, never less than thirteen thousand a year), while international students is $ 27,240 -35,280 (Obviously, this is a lie, but it just freshman tuition, plus go into the subject after the tuition did not count. even this deceptive data, how much tuition is still ranked second to Queen's University, was up a whole thousand knives! elective war a year before school starts, when you try to open ROSI or ACORN log onto their account ...... - Ha, server crashes and Latin America at this time do not tell me, even if u whine to me, I still will not give you what the position of the elective system has been vulnerable?. even if more college students divided into numerous small group, as long as the time is up, the server immediately collapse, without exception, is the last priority after the card was brutal. If you ask how fragile in the end? you can try to go to the Spring Festival rush 12306 train ticket to try. No matter how many times you refresh, you still can not enter the payment page from the ballot page. also, how much is all of course have a maximum number, as long as you choose a little late into the waiting list can only pray inside . of course, if you vote or sister school seniors male female votes to force, or through their high school elective Pa priority to help you live a position, and then turn off after a waiting list system, allowing them to transfer it to you (PS.: but the secret of this small series of two mixed much to learn, and others I do not tell him) to get up to see the winter when the weather today ...! - the apparent temperature is minus 40 degrees What gui how much the coldest time, but can achieve somatosensory! temperature -40 degrees Celsius, the temperature in this small series also express my nose froze. so in order to resist such bad weather, you can buy a small partner mask, or you can feel what air knife frost sword standing at the window watching the snow had blocked the road, and then going to see the school's official website has not released closed when the news ...... - close Xiesha Jia and Scarborough campuses closed, St. George Campus normal classes from how to build since the school, he had closed only three times. the first time was in a war, and the second, in World war II, the third time in three wars. Sorry, wrong, not three wars, in fact, the third time Yes. according to this rule, much the same as the severity of the fire world war ah, in the case where the class how University College fire, there is now something I feel very powerful aha. in addition to these three, regardless of squally showers, feather snow, you have to attend class. Xiaobian experienced in large typhoon in school is what it feels like, but also tried to tread half a meter thick, big snowy forward to how hard the classroom. courses were found myself bell curve down time ...... -? to the rumors of 67 in order to control how much the quality of education, the average score on the end of the period there are very strict restrictions professor can do in two ways, first, if you score before the end of the period is too high, they are very witty increase the difficulty of the exam. they control on the difficulty of the exam really reached a pinnacle, just right every time, see that they have done a lot back. Second, they can decide cruve, what does that mean? It is to adjust the score, if they reduce the high, low if they are raised. Raised naturally happy, but when it is lowered, the acid that cool ...... when the school bully classmate told you already post the final grade, you have a cheap hand to open rosi transcript when ...... - on God, earth ah, why do you have to abuse me! In a public inside the elite, has always been much lower average gpa no friends. Even some professors said: ""So you can see that the average GPA at Brown is almost a 3.7 You would have to take at least 5 or 6 different drugs to even be able to IMAGINE that being the case at U of T.. "" What does that mean? If you think that other schools just as easily take a 3.7GPA, I have to advise you to take drugs and then go dreaming. Sitting robart library, listening to the whistling sound of the ambulance, saw a comrade being carried away when ...... - I'm great, I actually carry down every exam season, the library is always crowded, and this situation is day and night. Many small partners have more than 20 hours of continuous learning experience in the library. Because all kinds of people to sit for too long, and looking masseur. Fortunately, much still a little humanity, during the exam season, will provide free massages. But even so, there are still countless comrades fell in before dawn (before the exam), then only ask the ambulance came. Light enough to learn to fight exhaustion, they saw a large circle of friends or God on facebook when they sent to participate in various activities on tall photo ...... - as are the people, how the gap is so big? Each time through BA (Bahen Center), I will feel a kind of coercion from the Great God. Because it is home to a large group of people dancing cow, whose name is called engineering science. According to Xiao Bian introduce a friend in the group life, these people inside, with a variety of magical characters. For example, some people from coming to class, but each time the test is to direct 4.0; it was in junior high school on their own in the absence of contact with the case of calculus, the calculus derived; someone junior program has been worked in google the manager; someone sophomore level independent study finished PHD PHD professor of quantum mechanics and test hired assistants. So how much do into pride, because it has a genius-level people from around the world. On the screen to see the familiar building when ...... - hey? This prison looked familiar ah? Whether you come too big, in fact, you may already have inadvertently seen his shadow on the screen. But how big a star because, ah, now being used to do all kinds of movies filmed. For example, one of the classic Resident Evil shot, Alice in prison fight, and that prison is actually Robert Library (the library like a peacock). Why shoot zombie movie library to get it? Yes, because we are all zombie, but a knowledge of food. If you see a person suspected of a star in front of you through, no doubt, that is the star. What?

We will in the original ""Internship Experience Guide"" on the basis of updated more from experience, do please look forward to! ECO Prep sophomore big talk of God Accounting Courses: Since 2011 RSM219 emergence arrangements accounting curriculum was completely disrupted. From the beginning sophomore, 219> 220> 221> 320> 321> 426, after a previous one is the pre-requisite. In other words, as long as any of them drop a class, it must make up with Summer time. You will find, RSM221 not be completed during the second year. In addition, seniors recommend accounting students complete ECO209 and RSM230. Financial classmates, quietly tell you, ECO Prep seniors test CFALevel I probably only reviewed when thirty or forty hours. The reason is simple CFA Level I overwrite the contents of 30% accounting RSM220 / 221 / 320,30 ~ 40% is ECO100 / 204/209/220 and RSM230 / 330,20% are professional ethics, and the rest is RSM430 / 432/433 / 435. (CFA team passed the exams and the latest CPA exam in the future we will continue to publish on CFA, CPA's introduction.) RSM219: RSM219 accounting introductory course is compulsory for all students Rotman. Zuliani has been run by a theme and design. This course really is an introductory course in accounting, though seemingly simple, especially when many Canadian-trained accountant Grade11,12 students feel easy. However, each year many learned a little accounting students are careless, then finally pit miserable. Seniors absolutely recommend this course to deal carefully, course requirements are not difficult in itself, but is required to lay the foundation for the strong RSM200 + / 300 + / 400 + courses. Elective, because the Zuliani is out of question, Professor, but the people themselves also quite nice (although there are times made a big temper), it is proposed to her class. But this course is not a lot pasttest resources. Zuliani prefer to use the original title, so she did not like the previous test leak out. This course before midterm law is very simple, to all kinds of high, hard and final burst to pressure points. Other professors, such as Edward Alex and so is not very clear. Interested students can go try. For many senior students, accounting last class RSM426 is Zuliani and Richardson taught. The first door Accounting Division and a final accounting class by a teacher, the final will be very moving. Every year, the last class of students in the class Zuliani CRY. RSM219 key is to lay the foundation for all future Accounting class, to a clear understanding of Debit / Credit and Basic Financial Statement. Generally the first semester of academic stress is not too heavy, must pass RSM219 lay a solid foundation. Special attention to this simple course Midterm, Final will be much more difficult. (However, compared to the difficulty and RSM220, or worse lot) RSM220: This door is a real accounting introductory course. Also particularly useful for students who finance. Accounting is not simply a record debit, credit that simple. RSM220 mainly on the purpose of accounting standards and how to follow the requirements of accounting standards at the right time, at the right subjects, remember the correct amount. This course is taught in the past by our dear Marshal Ge Dela root Dragan and friendly Chinese professor BaohuaXin together, but this course does not teach the main lecturer Dragan 220 last year to predict the likelihood is relatively small. However, this year we came back to teach Chinese Professor Baohua up. Baohua lectures very logical, with his good ideas, his lectures carefully understand each page of the test scores are an absolute effect. Baohua thinking more in line with Chinese students in class well organized, very clear test sites. But Dragan and difference than some creativity. But Baohua is very, very good professor, I like his seniors. Before he could be class and Chinese students also speak Chinese, but since he also found that Chinese students and more outrageous, he will no longer class and students with Chinese explanation. So I said the first time and he really Chinese, but also after the end of this course. Also next year, a professor Eszter, online information about her less. In fact, she also taught for many years at the Rotman, but in recent years did not teach RSM220. This year she will teach RSM220 / RSM222, as these programs are similar. This course must be writing assignment Oh, be regarded as a beginning, the future RSM221 / 320/322 have to write much more. About RSM220, the best way to learn is to do in addition to the title, other than reading, it is to weekly Tutorial. RSM220 the TA who will lead the students to do the Tutorial past Past Test, as well as help summarized RSM220 focus. RSM220 main difficulty is knowledge very much, but each can become a knowledge test sites, so many students overwhelmed. In fact, this course as long as a good school, listen carefully Tutorial, home reading summarize key points, not a very difficult course. Accounting and later actually is not all science, but to be treated as a liberal arts. RSM225: RSM225 on BusinessLaw and PersonalLaw. This course many students head feeling great, because you want to back a lot of knowledge. Beginning last year, this course seems to be how each prof batch volume will be slightly different. I remember when not review rote Oh, to be back keyword! Also, if a teacher can have a sort of notes, will be of great help. I intend to apply for law school students, this introductory course, but just oh. RSM222: RSM222 is compulsory for all students Rotman. This course if not Accounting students must seriously face. Because many Fixed Cost, Variable Cost issues in the interview, work is also very commonly used in the future. I have a consultation in the last interview on how to effectively reduce the cost, is entirely from a reduction of various variable cost to find the breakeven point. And in Finance in financial modeling is also taking into account the various changes in the cost. This year has been the main instructor Hai Lu do not teach RSM222, and the Donna Losell, Gus DeFranco and Eszter teach together. Donna is very personal teacher, everyone on RSM322 time encounter her again. I remember her class do not be late, do not play phone, and not to talk to the person next to speak; otherwise you will be rushed to the outside. Gus DeFranco also be evaluated in recent years. In addition this year is Eszter Protestant RSM220, RSM222 the teacher. Overall, this year compared to last year and lecture team of teachers vary widely. RSM222 itself is very simple, mainly to understand the concepts, these basic Management Accounting also later worked the longest encountered. For example, Process flow, Activity based costing; especially considering the various methods of calculation of Variance. Content RSM222 and now CPA exam Core2 very similar exams, students who want to take the CPA must work hard in this course. Similarly, this course the best way is to review the weekly tutorial, practice and review questions to the teacher. Last year, a midterm exam exercises of the original title. Little Helper is the recent launch of Raiders freshman series, including life science, computer science, rotman commerce and other elective subjects recommendations and course descriptions, and various guidelines for living in Toronto.

CSC207H1, CSC236H1 / CSC240H1, CSC258H1, CSC263H1 / CSC265H1; STA247H1 / STA255H1 / STA257H1 can be seen in the freshman and sophomore courses only major difference between the Specialist and CSC209, so tangled in the end is a specialist or major children's shoes in the freshman and sophomore does not worry too much about the differences with the course on. (To mention here, specialist and both large and several major election are to receive retroactive fee, so late into the professional want to save money this way does not work) and then look into the professional requirements: Specialist & Major: Applying using thefirst set of criteria: · An average mark of atleast 67% in CSC148H1 and CSC165H1 / CSC240H1 with a minimum mark of 60% in each course · Completion of 4.0 FCEsThose who do not meetthe first set of criteria will be considered using the second set of criteria : · Completion of CSC148H1, CSC165H1, MAT136H1 / MAT137Y1 / MAT157Y1 · CSC207H1 and CSC236H1 / CSC240H1 with an average grade of at least 70% · Completion of 4.0 FCEs Minor: Applying using thefirst set of criteria: · An average mark of atleast 75% . in CSC148H1 and CSC165H1 / CSC240H1 · Completion of 4.0 FCEsThose who do not meetthe first set of criteria will be considered using the second set of criteria: · Completion of CSC148H1, CSC165H1 / CSC240H1 · CSC207H1 and CSC236H1 / CSC240H1 with an average mark of 75 % · Completion of 4.0 FCEs Yes, yes, Minor requirements rather than major and specialist. So we decided to choose minor children's shoes must be early to prepare. Course Description: (CSC108, CSC148) / CSC150: CSC150 for several years did not open, so we will choose the 108 and 148. CSC108 CSC148 and the language used is python, CSC108 more emphasis on basic grammar and applications, CSC148 more focused on simple data structures and program logic. Since CSC108 not into professional requirements, so there python or other programming based students can choose to skip directly on CSC148. Of course, CSC108 no programming foundation for, or would like to look over at the first semester of students, it is still a good choice. Course difficulty CSC108 and CSC148 is not high, especially CSC108 is a name of 'water class', but in order to achieve a satisfactory result did not lay the foundation for future CS road, then he needs a certain effort. Especially in the assignment when, under the circumstances of his teammates also a suggestion to write their own, only to write their own can truly understand the essence of this course. CSC165 / CSC240: CSC165 and CSC240 are theoretical courses, teaching content does not include specific programming, does not require programming student, and focuses on the logical proof of the algorithm and data structure. CSC165 is the basic theory courses, mainly on logic and proof, and simple algorithm analysis, is not difficult but I think it is a very useful course, the logic is not only useful for CS and prove, for example, mathematics in other , statistics and other courses have played a considerable role. CSC240 is a very interesting, but the difficulty is quite large, and heavy academic burden on a course equivalent to the enhanced version CSC165 + CSC236, and want to choose this course the students must be very prudent, do not because of the seniors you say this course is very interesting to learn more, or what went wrong seek death. Learn more of course not wrong, but when the course is far greater than their level of difficulty, you will find that in the end you did not learn anything, wasted so much time. Of course, the level of their mathematical confidence, CSC240 would be a good choice, in this course, the exposure to the various aspects of strengthening deepen knowledge will greatly enhance your way of thinking, your perspective is no longer confined to so short answer to solving the problem surface. Then you do not choose CSC240 only CSC236 this road, there is nothing to say. (MAT135H, MAT136H) / MAT137Y / MAT157YMAT135 and MAT136 is only in recent years added to CSC's calendar, fully focused on computing, and almost no theoretical proof, not very personal recommendation, because of the sheer computing does not make you really learn anything, problem-solving and logical thinking is the way of the future, you can rely on the 'weapon'. MAT137Y moderate difficulty, the individual is more recommended, the computational requirements than MAT135, MAT136 length of each other, but more emphasis on the theory and demonstrate for sophomore math class can be described as any harm. As MAT157, is a rather difficult, a course progress quite fast, their way of thinking and mathematical ability for the requirements of the average person is very difficult to achieve, here advise not undergone the Chinese college entrance examination or test students or math contest Do not try for the better. Incidentally, if you do not ask seniors which case up on the recommendation MAT157, please pull him black. CSC207H: This is the first door CS courses in real Software Engineering courses, this course focuses on the design of program structure, agile development and teamwork, coding a substantial increase in the amount of, a person can be very difficult to turn the tide. This course from 2014 joined the Android programming, according to the needs of the job is to write a androidapp, although the difficulty is not high, but very suitable as a Software Engineering software development and mobile end entry point. CSC236H / CSC240H: important things to say three times: CSC240 CSC240 carefully choose carefully choose carefully choose CSC240 CSC258H1:!!! This is a course introduced hardware, classroom content focused on a variety of hardware working principle and structure, lab and project focusing on hardware programming. This lesson will consume a lot of time, we do not recommend this course requires a lot of time and the same lesson CSC209, CSC263, etc. in the same semester. From general terms, the difficulty of the course exam is not large, serious school doing lab was able to get a very satisfactory score. (Hardware not like the students may feel a little hard, you can find a friend like this area with the team lab, the two complement each other more efficient). CSC209H: CSC209 This course is the starting point for system programming, which describes the Terminal (Bash) on the basis of use, as well as the C programming. According to the experience of individual work, Bash is a very useful addition to IDE, the most commonly used is BASH, either git, svn or simply copy copy, and even server detection, requires the use of BASH. C, as a very classic programming language, closer to the bottom of the running logic clearer, four assignment progressively, can be said to want the students to OS development opened a new door. CSC263H / CSC265H: either subject private thought is CS course top priority, at the end of sophomore year to juniors and seniors more in-depth study has played a very important role nexus. This course introduces the ""Introduction to Algorithms"" very classic algorithms and data structures, the usual operations extended and supplemental course content but also let you use very rewarding. Whether you want the students to the theory or the code of agricultural development direction, the content of this course is introduced very practical. Many companies also mentioned in the interview part of the course in the study. Recommendations on this course the students have to read more books, this course really understand, so that future learning to cope. For CSC265H, the difficulty of the course has gone beyond the level of ordinary people can imagine, unless you are on the CSC240 and have achieved good results and be sure not to try, do not try, do not try this course! ! ! MAT223H: compulsory, personally I feel that in the freshman year, and more trim MAT224.Linear Algebra is almost always useless in all CS field, learn the future can reduce a lot of unnecessary trouble. STA247 / 255/257: In fact, I recommend the STA257, first, the difficulty is not large, many programs require proof of logical thinking part actually closer to CS, but compared to STA247, STA257 is a lot more advanced courses STA the prerequisite, is worth on. CSC343H: third-year CS course of a relatively simple course introduces the database and the use of XML, but also very practical algorithms and mathematical skills almost no requirements, coupled with Diane Horton points to a more relaxed, suitable for a sophomore out. In fact, CS learning more focused way of thinking and problem solving, rather than to make money just learn a few programming language. Programming languages ​​always upgrading, under a code farming can replace another, but the way of thinking can not be replaced, so a good way of thinking that allows you to stand higher and see farther. Finally, a few words to say: CS must learn to live within its means, not because others have recommended or 'learn more What's wrong with' went far beyond their ability to choose the course, to learn more of course not wrong, but it is based can learn understanding based on the understanding of a problem, what is more to learn? There are aspects of cooperation and teamwork than to live pennies each do a little, but should really be involved, participate in the discussion and modification, to understand why such a design program, so the operation of the code, or the job is completed on the surface of the well, to the test, as well as the company's interview will realize their true enough.

Entropy no reason to exist in this world of increased intake of negative entropy is the essence of our living. Like learning to eat, our lives, there are also more importantly, reduce the entropy process. Like the cutlery to food, a cup of the wine of the importance of toilet doubt. Let us with awe and appreciate how much we take for granted on campus these are the earth, the forgotten, the habit, to give us the pleasure of the important place, toilets. Also before the first cold, then warm season, the students experienced the first wave of turbulent midterm opt into Sage time. Through the large windows of the library, the sky was clear, the air was filled with the taste of dog with everyone. ""It is time to go to the toilet"" learning Pa says, ""Do not learn to go on with their teeth, and cramped cubicles is your best destination."" Let us fine olfactory washroom, forcing unsolicited grid . After you hexagonal の thinking it over, still comes from the BGM played Robarts classic hexagon floor large luxury models lengthened toilet started. Verb verb playing time playing time, the ceiling is a triangle triangles triangular, hexagonal hexagonal hexagonal toilet. I remember every time RB learned the depths of love, always willing to go the third floor of a small toilet. Standing in the center of the hexagon, she stroked my withered shoulder and said life's most kind-hearted moments, like toilet water ... as bright. When I broke her arms, looking back, she was still in the corner of my swallowing vicissitudes. Gentle hard bench outside the terms of sensory experience to analyze it, I have to mention big Con Hall toilet. It is difficult to describe the first time I saw her amazing. Who would have thought, next time ravaged by centuries of thousands of pit unexpectedly deep for you, the United States if the daughter of a large modern bathroom. This better not rigidly adhere to the bladder, it is functional gentle everyone even when squatting hard bench. But that is only a small flaw: to squeeze before class, after class squeeze into nothing. Thin-length mirror, white as snow light, rubbing our body and soul. Inside and outside the strong contrast Meng, so I do not shout. In fact, spell the fans of the University of Toronto also has a word of mouth toilets Zhiyi, UC is not that there is a sense of high female toilet in the basement there is a magic spell. If it is flat chest sister, midnight am, a person close their eyes walked in, shut the door, faded pants, shouted ""It's great, Mr. elephants!"" Will have ""very great elephant Mr. ""grow out. Sounds great look, sister who come out of No? If nothing happened, perhaps to verify the truth of injustice injustice. The relative positions of men and women on the toilet, we seem to UT men and women under the preference has a special taste of Saint Michael's College of St.Michael powerful rich in beauty, it is a story of college. You ask me why, I can only say no comment. Yes, the sex ratio imbalances unreservedly reflected in the details, I wonder if this projection is inexplicable restlessness of youth or sister who fanatical fantasy. Goldring-super sized sprung up in recent years, we have a gold ring, disdain for the group floor. But because the basement of the University of Toronto has the biggest pair of er Bale toilet. He looked at her, even if no face still conceal his affection. New people reluctant to get on. Black is not particularly low in vain, the way money is sound bite rattle sound. But it not like the toilet had not been through the fat times, is of no value. Of course, not just sink sleek white flowing liquid, seemingly blowing shells can be broken, the cold hard reality. Shutters on the second reminds me of fat stripes. Toilet style campus is different, unique color, ceramic tile in the pattern with a tease. Co-ed mix toilet Dafa is good, careful calculation, the school district has not had toilet Lin Xing Xiao Bian even more than half of the small series can not help but doubt, even the toilets can not hold hands together on how to talk about sex in love but some toilet college dormitories wit to solve this problem. Classmate for many years, Tong Fu toilet can not, so what memories of the good. MB fans of what open the door? what is this? My underwear off you let me look at this? Door did not open your panties off what ah Hey old door handle, somewhere slippery, I touch you, you ask me if I love, I answered only in the beginning of the heart is not old, Sesame.

Spewing out immediately who can remember when digital ah Hey, end white toilet door is unable to stop pinching. Toilet alma mater, thank you for such a wonderful bright, dull years I do stars. In conclusion, not left still trying to dry word Qi Xiao Bian again had eight children of two preaching to everyone: to seek realism in the fictional story's head must have a problem! So I take the trouble, be sure to personally born, squatting in a circle, take heart this experience - pleasure. Honey actually read throughout it! Honey here thank you!

Have any questions, leave a message to his assistant. I wish you all a pleasant small assistant (づ ¯3¯) づ ╭❤ ~ 1. Background Studies Pa articles: Double Specialist (Math Application & Stats), CS Minor average A + Legend important to say three times: I did not burst many points! I did not burst many points! I did not burst many points! (Department of Mathematics, as students, if you have not seen this picture, that small series can only say something: You're welcome!) Well, as the Chinese people to learn to do more professional, math elective actually very simple. Pa school version is divided into theoretical mathematics, applied mathematics learning slag Normal Edition. Let's talk about the theory of mathematics learning Pa develop the road, in fact, do not need elective, as long as you remember that you have to choose each mathematical code like the highest class. (Tracy heart is to see this collapse = =) in order to make such a school bully quantified guidance, I repeat courses. Freshman mat157, mat240, mat247. As a sophomore junior, the people are generally the existence of ghost schools, learning slag had no chance to see them, and they disdain and slag learn to discuss their course, because you must listen! Do not! understand! And the stage is in fact such a school lesson Pa selection of elective rather than people. You will receive an email prof passion invites you to challenge your intellengce. They usually use some thought interesting topic, or they will increase this year avg exaggeration to deceive you into the pit. Of course, the school bully, they just go to the classroom to prof occasionally a little face, and do not need the guidance of prof's own home can 90+. For applied mathematics, half of the students are eco-related, because it sounds relatively tall on. The other half of the students mingled with CS, BIO, PHY, CHE, there are many amazing professional. So mathematics is not a language but a subject of this sentence is really true. Starting from elective, if your title still under math department, it will certainly be a 137,223,224. In fact recommended to install a pseudo-science to 157 Pa, because you omitted sophomore 246 times. If you can not easily more than 80 137, then quickly turn to other professional sophomore right to continue studying mathematics will not make you happy. 137,223,224 belong Shuafen lesson, if you seek a little GPA, take a moment to get 4.0, because the future opportunities converge to 0. Especially domestic high school classmate, freshman mathematics can not get more than 4.0 to the motherland shame. Besides other professionals, students are forced to learn math, general professional require 137 or 135/136. Many people mistakenly think 135/136 is very simple, in fact, they cover a large number of calculations, the actual exam is far more difficult to get a high score. 137 recommendations try, anyway, what can drop down fear. Most of the above as a freshman enrollment guidance. Sophomore junior students, basically I have been booked subject POSt, that fact and then study enrollment actually little significance. In short, the lesson is simple Hurry 4.0, difficult lesson to learn as long as the school to Kill undead, choose their own professional pit dug themselves fill it. Finally, we encourage word, 200 level courses in math is basically common mathematical supremum, the completion of 237,257 is basically the brain of your life to develop the most advanced period of time, the big three four classes, especially at the beginning of APM class pay more attention to the application, not the theoretical requirements so strong. After so many sophomore students learn mathematics 237 if you feel tired and do not feel love, then advise you to hold on, the clouds have passed. Finally, the school bully who say, math class more difficult, but a lot of bonus, idle nothing unexploded explosive sub play good, wholesome month burst a burst. (Tracy wrong, then do not ask him, after the elective TAT) 2 ordinary articles Background:. Math Application (Econ $ Fina) Specialist B are concerned that sharing my personal experience it elective. I had tangled election actuarial or statistical or mathematical, so choose these courses all program needs, including eco100, mat137, mat223, mat224, csc108. But it is still not chosen mat157 for a little regret, because there is no God and mat157 it difficult. And if the repair is mat157, if you are going to read mathematical applications in economics and finance specialist can waive off mat246. About election professor mat137: Actually Meng Meng Alfonso taught very good, very well organized, I have some time before TA strike on another class of prof friend listened Alfonso classes go, would rather give up the end of the strike looks more handsome prof of lesson. This course is not difficult, basically have notes and then read a book brush title will not be much problem, but the examination should pay attention to the details when, in fact, fall is not particularly easy assignment. mat223: Getting very linear algebra, less abstract. I chose this course to teach the very general to the prof, (many people have fled to other prof lesson) but in fact learn a lesson prof who does not decide anything. This course fall term, when we learn very happy feel very water, but spring term when students learn to reflect not so water, the specific reasons unknown ... The door linear algebra class but it is still very basic, serious and thorough study book brush type there is no question too many problems. mat224: mat223 enhanced version of the book is difficult to understand, and sometimes read with no eggs, a good brush questions sometimes really enlightened. At first I always dislike uppal flamboyant blackboard skipped school to go, so the first midterm tragic death ... So far rehabilitation lectures, in fact, found uppal lectures very clear idea, and sometimes went to his office hour, he would after solving the problem again comb knowledge, help big. In short, good eyesight is recommended to listen to children uppal class anymore with bad eyesight Vice good glasses grab front row positions on his class. (Of course not other prof class no comments ...) csc108: mainly about some introductory knowledge of python, specifically zero basic design, the class is quite happy, but not the video can be seen there on weekends, but assignment really is a pain, we must look at the requirements, or with the prohibition of the use of the code do not know how to fail. eco100: This course furlong very gentle, he will always be before the exam curve a lot of points, but if you do not work hard, final, when he can not help you. Knowledge will be a lot more difficult exam g of God, but for tyrants learn to get better either.

But imagine you bought a return ticket early, but because rehabilitation had to unsubscribe, and then look at how much Summer tuition than just luxury but also fascinated, indeed we still have to learn ah. ECO100Y (Introductionto Economics) ECO100 into micro-economic (micro) and macro (macro), is divided into two semesters. ECO100 this course is to develop the most crucial ability to understand knowledge. To suggest that you develop good study habits, after-school day combing the knowledge class, do not wait to test the re-thinking of learning, otherwise it probably will when the time is this: RC year students do not need to enroll into RC as in previous years your Session, you can choose any one professor. Each Session, only Pesando lesson to the RC student enrollment priority (Priority). Last year, three professors were Pesando, Benjamin and Jessica. Test 3 last year and in the circle of friends of various scolded, even being on Facebook pulls Instagram beauty PhD Jessica no longer can be said to teach people to breathe, but is instead Gazzale was more terror in the name of the topic . (In short, do not imagine how good life friends.) (See the classroom, and on to the micro letter you look at Jessica, right), although the focus of this year you can choose any one professor, but strongly recommends that seniors choose Pesando and the Gazzale class. These professors will speak more sophomore content, although will increase the difficulty, but for future study would be helpful. 90+ get a big theological long Gazzle Session said, ECO204 have an even more horrible than five times Gazzale professor Ajex Hussain, freshman time to learn something that will make you a lot better in his class. Between Pesando and Gazzale, more seniors recommended Pesando. Pesando / Loren Brandt (L0101) Pesando: deserved the best education teacher, 17-year-old Harvard prodigy course is famous for deep intuition. 15 years of teaching experience, teaching clearly organized, always feel benefit in his class. The most serious lesson of his class is also my sister on no one. In his class requires diligent notes (her friends because he learned to comfortably also quite powerful), and the class he also humorous, very interesting. I've seen the least rate of skipped school classroom professor. There was a sister school seniors and we say Pesando class will be relatively harder, roll-out routines are slightly different topic each year. But to be fair I think Pesando examination paper easy to use, personal feel his annual examination paper and past test are similar, are routine, he mastered the routine you're 666, did not grasp the routine, do not panic, summer met. Brandt: Pesando partner this year and is no longer a girl's mind doctoral student Jessica (seniors represented tucao did Jessica's Banana Republic questions, see each mall store will think of her), but as Noranda Chair of Loren Brandt. Loren was the first time to teach ECO100, but is responsible for the annual high school he taught economics can be described as experienced. Say it happened last year, Professor Benjamin and Loren have similarities, the two are no longer a professor ECO100, and very identity ECO Department, while two had also worked out the Journal. Seniors forecast Loren style will be similar to Benjamin, it should follow the routine questions (previous year Benjamin title, although simple, was regarded as fair.) Gazzale (L0201 L0301) listen to the name I felt horrible Gazzale alone occupied two a Session, and the person in charge of teaching a year. Although the professor a question of terror, but based on lectures he said seniors is really super good. Slides done very carefully and will not be the same as Jessica scripted. Gazzale Pesando more than a term test, but the difficulty is much higher, it is difficult to find routines (seniors that this is a serious performance problem), but a large part of his final exam problem is relatively simple, it would be a good news. LO401 L5101 L5201Furlong, Wolfson class seniors do not recommend you to choose the RC. The professor did not responsible for RC session, so the lessons learned will be less inconvenient and post-course convergence. Professor L0401 set aside Italian accent did not say, his own teaching is relatively inexperienced, last year the average roll Test 1 goes to 85 points (in what is simply unforgivable way), so had to rely on the late Professor Benjamin large title pressure points, which makes students feel very suited. MAT Calculus compulsory MAT133Y1 / MAT135H1 + MAT136H1 / MAT137Y1 / MAT157Y1 4 election a MAT133RC mathematics camp. MAT133 is a soft girl, but she is on the slag slag does not mean (ah good dirt ///) but have to say for the RC, the 133 is a math curriculum for the RC, is a suitable choice. Professor Tate, then recommend domineering grandmother. Writing on the blackboard clearly, the whole notes and amiable. Attach the famous Tate grandmother lesson: MAT135 + MAT136 calculation, calculation or calculations. For RC students, this course may be some underachievement. Unlike mat133 about financial mathematics, unlike mat137 we lay the foundation for some of the science major. So if the RC for students, personal feel not very recommended 135,136. MAT137 proof or proof. For major actuarial, statistics and the like-minded can choose this course. MAT157 pure mathematics. Suffice it to say, if you have the courage to choose this lesson, you come to RC doing? RSM100H / MGT100H (Introduction to Management) RSM100 and MGT100 content should be the same, except for the ArtSci MGT100 other professional students wish to transfer Rotman opened. In last year's RSM lesson it covers three specialists (finance, accounting, management) all the basics that can be selected after the RC, but six months into the year after school, I heard that the accounting portion removed, because we can choose it directly RSM219 . This course is no trick, everything is all syllabus content class book +. Before every year by the two professors were teaching: first semester by Professor John, taught more boring (on his 15-minute class will be able to successfully put my urge to sleep), high rate of skipped school, divided equally low. Responsible for the second semester by Khan (folk called him Khan) is very active in his class, he was able to learn a lot of lessons. (So ​​this year if Micheal Khan taught it, but also suggest that you vote for him.) The professor is extremely lazy, the volume and past test is almost the same (to change the title to change the name change is not the full range), the club were relatively high. This course is subject to change in the last year, the sister school seniors do not really envious of. Recommended course last year before the new changes, three originally selected in order sophomore courses, new freshman students can choose. All three courses are RSM219H1, RSM230H1 and RSM250H1, according to the Calendar view, these courses is strongly recommended freshman elective. All three are Financial Accounting, Financial Markets and Principles of Marketing introductory courses, Prerequisite are RSM100. Since this year, only three courses is recommended elective freshman, sophomore sister school seniors who do not have much experience on these courses. We asked previous Rotman students, several professors recommend the following for reference, but does not exclude the possibility to mobilize the teachers arrange oh.

Innis Innis Cafe in the main building next to the Robarts library, cafeteria and other College different, this small cafe is a family kitchen, especially the man of the house warm and friendly. In warm weather, you can enjoy a moment of rest basking in the sun outdoors. Here you can buy Smoothie, sandwiches, salads (not just leaf vegetables, as well as a variety of fresh homemade salad yo), all-day breakfast and chicken rice packages, etc., in general, very healthy, in the middle of the girls very popular. Innis Cafe the price is cheap, but the component that is not small, really inexpensive. In addition to the main meal and some dessert, which is very interesting is Rice Cake: banana leaf package glutinous rice, much like a large heavenly bamboo rice dumplings x Yeah. Innis Cafe biggest flaw is that many people, at noon when the team longer. - Harvest Noon - Address: 16 Bancroft Avenue, GSU ​​Building second floor (next to the Earth Science Building Auditorium ES1050) Time: 10am - 2am (for coffee, tea and baked goods) 11:30 am (for lunch) website: http: // harvestnoon.com/ this is a mystery shop run by students, respected vegan doctrine (veganism). Because of its secluded location secret, this Cafe can say is known. Down the narrow stairs up, you will find here a paradise on earth, quiet and tranquil. If you arrive early, students will see the men working in the kitchen preparing lunch today. Soaring prices, but The moon has maintained a low price conscience. Register (work or pay a membership fee), then you can enjoy the member price, as well as a variety of activities to take part (which are mostly associated with eating ha ha). There are two main course every day, you can choose one or both, with salad, homemade bread and hummus composition packages. Xiaobian eaten here twice, I feel good light, but it leads to student self-mode relative lack of rules, sometimes obviously should be full of dry goods stew, sung to the bowl, but you become a water scarcity broth . Previously mentioned here are vegan, plus dishes rarely fuel consumption, low heat while the top is not very full, so small series that is more suitable for little girls meal. We must emphatically recommended his home made desserts are generally a little Muffin, the taste is very delicate, unique flavor, but not to eat sugar and heavy oil, private thought than the market to sell most Muffin stronger on more than one level. - The Exchange Cafe - Address: Rotman School, 105 St.George Street Time: Weekday 6:30 am - 7:30 pm; Saturday 8:00 am - 3:00 am Website: http: //www.theexchangecafe.ca/Robarts library across the street the Rotman floor building, good environment, dishes are rich, overall good level, but it was assessed quality of the dishes is not stable. Fixed menu is very Western, including menu All day Breakfast, main meal salad (salmon or chicken, but not enough fresh vegetables dry side) and hamburger steak, and so on. In addition, The Express often sell three kinds of lunch, kitchen specialties and one of the current system, both on a weekly basis update cycle (the Jerk Chicken lunch - well done). The Express Cafe provides buffet Tuesday or Thursday 8 knife 10 knife, although alternative types of cheap but relatively simple, there will be topics (such as pizza, sandwiches or something ...). Although quick lunch, but in the afternoon, dishes will become very stale, it is recommended that you avoid dinner later lunch. Other dishes are cooked to order, you will receive a reminder with a small device after a meal, after a good dish shiny sound to remind you to take food. - Sammy's Student Exchange - Address: 7 Hart House Circle Time: Weekdays 8am - 8pm; Saturday 11 am-3:30pm Website: http: //www.sammysstudentexchange.com/ store is located in Hart House, the environment is very good, but small series I do not particularly like it here! So why mention him? The first is bad at the reminder to everyone here, and the other is here recommended a variety of grilled chicken breast, ideal for after Hart House Fitness Center sports protein supplements (in small series only advantage). The following is a Tucao: you buy rice obviously contribute to profits, but here's the aunt who got bills like your attitude clear how much money the same. Burrito folder inside the weird pickled pickles that taste is simply impossible to describe in words, to avoid must be avoided. The same price to buy a salad, in Innis Cafe are enough when a lunch, and here is a few pieces of leaf vegetables, and if you dare to choose salad dressing when there is the slightest hesitation, aunt's face just want to put salad dressing squeeze you look like. ...... Resentment may have exaggerated these components, refer to, Lehelehe like ...... - Hard Hat Cafe - Address: 10 King's College Road, Sanford Fleming basement Time: 10am - 5pm Website: https: // www. facebook.com/hardhatcafe/ this Cafe shop its name, with obvious engineers temperament, unpretentious, down to earth. Engineering students self-employed, the absolute price conscience (knife coffee or tea, but also cheaper than purchasing subway subway, two angle Phi Sacramento can of soda as long as five knives), do not spend tax. SF basement, next to the Indian takeaway Veda, so many people, delicious pizza so often robbed. There sell pizza, Subway, wraps packages and a variety of snacks, and is probably the only big selling whole Vitasoy place?

There are many kinds of curries to choose from, the most popular is Curry bowl (two kinds of curry with one kind of rice). Xiaobian want to recommend is Currito and Mango Lassi. Currito are burritos in Curry, it sounds wonderful but unexpectedly good, probably because it can eat curry and salty, coupled with his home-made Mango butter still somewhat fresh. Mango Lassi is labeled with mango and yogurt shakes, the first port amazing, but a bit high sweetness.

In the screams, ""the British Independent"" indignation after the British had to stay Meng turned weak weak to ask, ""What is the EU?."" . . Say the EU must first briefly talk about the history of the European egg pain. European terrain, even if the territory is not also bred dozens of different ethnic cultures. Our ancestors probably copied it, Europeans believe in ""not my race, its heart will be different."" Since the Renaissance battle it. In 1618 the first European large-scale war because of Martin Luther's Protestant want to get out in the open church incense other countries in Europe, and other countries to take this opportunity to start playing the ""self-defense war."" Europe is divided into old and new sects sect overtly fight for the faith, but in reality is a struggle for power sub-site child. First World War ended in 韦斯特法里亚 meeting, while the formation of a European ""韦斯特法里亚 system"", probably can be counted as the first time the EU. This system, European countries have the right to establish their own state religion as they see fit, so will stop the war. Taierbohe painted about confirmation ceremony 韦斯特法里亚 system collapse in 1648 Westphalia began in 1791, two years after the successful French Revolution. European countries are splashed his face bloody revolution, began to discuss the French Revolutionary Army killed in the French territory. Then a great idea, called juvenile Napoleon led the French army cut east west kill, destroy the anti-French alliance. French army Ruishi eventually lost to Russia's big, cold boundaries. In this friendly reminder to invade Russian friends, the first ready Canada Goose! (A slap in the face angry fans Hitler). The Second World War ended in the Vienna Conference, exiled Napoleon, the French admitted defeat, began a second European Union. After 100 years of peace in Europe, a war broke out in 1914, laid before the destruction of the European system again. The reason for the war in Europe is no longer called the war in Europe, because European colonies around the world have begun to battle it. After the war ended in 1918, he held a meeting in Versailles, formed the League of Nations, in unison, pointing to Germany, said, ""The policeman is the man!"" Eat Yaba Kui German only silence, until the outbreak of World War II. As a sequel to the war, he focused on a defeated Germany to make a comeback, put around the very Muslim neighbors annexation attempt to become a world power. Americans are angry, because when the world is their overlord Bank, how can allow a person to choke them? Germany once again to fight the Anglo-American coalition forces get on the ground, the world finally began a period of peace. This has to do with the EU? When a group of individual interests conflict with each other constantly, and bring peace to the world of the threat can not be ignored, those in power should take what measures? The easiest way is this rude individual interests of a group together to form a community of interests. This is the purpose of this fourth European Union, but also the fundamental EU legislation. EU member states there are three of the most important obligations and benefits: 1: As a people, the EU member states to pay their ""meals."" 2: member countries vote for EU legislation. 3: automatically considered citizens of member states of EU citizens, and the right to freedom of movement. From this we can conclude that three legal reasons with the EU in several British couples disharmony. First, the EU such ""the British Turner nacional"" organization, of course, be poor brothers welcome. After meals press force distribution may be welfare for everyone. And so the British Eton graduate of Oxford University's ancestral rich handsome is not necessarily so cold. Indeed, the perennial top three UK GDP in the EU in 2014 is more than France to become the second. Than the ""crane tail"" of Montenegro, Malta and other countries beyond forty-five times. Such a system back to the British EU to send strong evidence. After the British withdraw from the EU, it can no longer contribute to the EU duty, from the regulation of the European market. There is also a problem, due to the freedom of movement of population, behind other European countries people would have flocked to Britain, the British employment to locals burden. Moreover, compared to other refugees British immigration policy is relatively liberal countries can also be the opportunity to other countries as a springboard to further ""invasion"" of the United Kingdom. The UK is no way, because as the EU member states have to abide by the rules. Why not return it? Britain left the EU to send what theory? First, the EU is just a collection of man-made law, and can not control the market ""natural law."" Retreat Europe after the United Kingdom can not really put their continental plates tilt from Europe and moved somewhere else. Britain still needs Europe, Europe can no longer retire after the privilege of free trade of goods, but also time-consuming re-agreed trade treaty with the European continent, things work a half times. Besides immigration, why oppose refugees? Currently voice against refugees than naked racism row with his heart, but also could not find any decent answers. EU to send back with members of Robert Blay made a good example, he was one of Sri Lanka, Mr record second-generation immigrants have had such remarks: ""His family came to Britain in the 1970s, he is not qualified to be a Members' . Despite this, Mr born in England, longer than the United Kingdom, or be scolded for ""not qualified"", just because his parents are immigrants. After a successful return to Europe after the success of the British retreat Europe, the EU sent back immediately denied prior commitments. For example, the EU sent back before claiming the UK every week to the European Union to pay three hundred fifty million pounds (verification of false information), after the retreat Europe can take the money benefits the NHS system. The next day back to Europe after the retreat Europe faction leader immediately corrected himself, claiming that end will try to do, you can not make any guarantees. A more serious problem if it is successful British retreat Europe, may soon face another referendum, this requirement will be back in Scotland UK. In the referendum, 62 percent of Scots asked the British remain in the EU. Scotland are likely to take this retreat Europe fuss, started the independence movement again, and as an independent country to join the EU. The British lost no longer just the European market, but also with the loss of even Scotland. A new round of US presidential election the Republican candidate Donald Trump (Donald Trump) plans this month 24, the British referendum on Europe after the retreat day visit Scotland, he participated in the importance of European integration Resort Golf in Scotland as can affect the entire world situation in Europe, we need to be a live reins controls. In recent years, the prevalence of nationalism in Europe. Hungarian Jobbik party as a Nazi successors seems to attract more and more people, the implementation of the year in Hungary Nazi terror. One Roma Jobbik party villages were looted and destroyed. This is the European division of the precursor. When Europe wants every country is how to maximize their own interests, we will only get violent collision. It may sound naive, but only Europe purposes will not really push themselves into the civil war between the integration of many ethnic groups and countries in Europe beyond redemption.

STA no 100level class, but how can you want to repair without first statistical overview of the situation, think about life. Recommended incumbent STA261instructor great God Yan Hao son article http://blog.renren.com/share/247777072/15678766252 MAT / CSC courses refer to a series of newborn Raiders assistant. The official also recommended coursefinder http://coursefinder.utoronto.ca/course-search/search/courseSearch?viewId=CourseSearch-FormView&methodToCall=start2, repair specialist is not recommended students only choose the simplest class (coursecode figures and in most cases large classes are considered to be more difficult), because ... you have selected the specialist of ... such as repair Appliedstat if in fact you can choose STA220 & 255, but this combination is set up to provide background relatively wide range such as a friend of students was the repair, for tomorrow tall buildings, or lay the foundation for 257/261 bar. 3, the same course what the election session? First, note instructor, to look at the ratemyprof predecessors with blood and tears depict the instructor image. Then, look at the time there is no conflict recommendation Scheduling artifact griddyhttp:. //griddy.org/4, Would like to repair Applied students, remember your potentialfocus study courses, freshman that is removed to lifescience other basic classes. 5, how do you think so little lesson? Bao forgotten freshman can choose MAT223 / 240 as well as elective courses. Revised statistics we need to complete 2.0credits liberal arts curriculum (breadthrequirement 1/2/3) ... so the ""water course"" is a perennial topic ... ANT253, CLA201 / 204, PHY205, PHL245 (Special thanks to the following two paragraphs son Yan Hao ) stat and the major lesson spe Explanation: statistics spe compulsory only 10.5 credits, relative to other professional spe, compulsory courses is very small. Great ⼀ Approximate II required course, there is no class too difficult, but not very good at math students may encounter trouble in MAT237 ⿇ in. STA257,261 fact, the difficulty is not large, but since most of the students are the first frame exposure probability theory and statistics, if you can not accept new things quickly, it may become a stumbling block in either subject. In the senior class, since STA410 and STA442 presence, before so many students do not choose statistics spe. STA442 is not so difficult, but the workload is really great. STA410 between different professors, the gap will be very difficult. In the last set of 1.5-credit classes, we can in mathematics, statistics, actuarial, computer arbitrarily selected three ⻔ class. However, due to the actuarial courses leading class comes in handy strict censorship, which is why we have not studied actuarial junior class students who are not selected from the actuarial 400+ level course. You can only choose in mathematics, computer, statistics. If only to scrape together the full credits to complete the program, then three ⻔ are selected statistics class. Because of the low statistical lesson or difficulty than mathematics and computers. If you want Approximate later want to learn more, we recommend building more courses in mathematics and computers, even if not in class, you can self-study. Statistics spe only 10.5 credits, even if only a plus BR 12.5 credits. So completing compulsory basis, it took all of the Department of Statistics offer lesson repair it, so do not add up to 20 credits Approximate more than we can repair the door to get accustomed additional mathematics with computer classes, so that regardless of the future is to apply graduate school or work, are of great help. Statistics Major relatively speaking, is relatively simple, you can choose a Approximate MAT133, two Approximate can choose STA220 + STA255. Difficulty with statistics on spe ⽐ ⼩ lot. (Xiao Bian reminder, if capacity is sufficient, or do not choose the easiest class, high school class after a bit difficult.) Besides the high grade class, based on the STA302 can easily repair with three classes and ⼀ door 300+ 400+ above class. On the calendar of presentation has been given the recommended curriculum, based on personal experience with everyone's feedback, STA303,304,305,437 be less difficult ratio of an class, there is not much theoretical calculation based. I do not like to prove students can be considered. Of course, you can also refer to the recommended calendar given. Br good to introduce the following classes (Keke, Xiao Bian found, the authors give us a lot of Amway EAS classes, but enrollment in addition to a good time to score points, the interest is very important yo!) ANT100ANT100 freshman anthropology compulsory, but because it is good and simple to mentally handicapped br curriculum (and did not) so many students in droves. This course is very rare and br4 br3 meet half the freshman class. ANT100 divided into four parts, socio-cultural Anthropology, biological Anthropology, archaeological Anthropology, and linguistic Anthropology. Professor teaches three different sub-chapter, each chapter will need to use different books (bookstore Yao face). This course is a great amount of reading, ppt lot, but the professor after class each lesson will po lecture notes and after-school issues. If someone is not particularly willing to big night on the con hall hours course, these lecture notes and after-school problems to cope with 70% of the content of the examination. The door of the tasks required for the lesson exam test twice a year, every 60 multiple-choice questions and a need for up to three months after a proposal, draft and revision of the essay plus points and the calculated ground participation points tut, then. . . Gone. . . . . . . This course is highly recommended to do minor fill br lesson one in the course of time can be consumed very little, basically do not usually pay attention to, when the examination brush past test and after-school problem like, it will not when you can use three long, one short shortest election candidate to be occult, but want to test scores really not very easy lesson in itself something really simple professor, archeology, ancient human evolutionary psychology, ethnography , social and cultural anthropology that most people will never meet the information will be here frequently, it involves a wide range of people as much as is really not much more than the freshman class can. Xiao Bian is recommended that this course ncr, do not let this course gpa drag. EAS103EAS103 East Asian history freshman courses, half lesson br3. This course focuses on the three East Asian countries in the history of pre-modern1800, the period involved Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, three text development, evolution myth, ideology, cultural dissemination. Ten of the calculated ground tut and four to several reading response (small essay). Each small essay have accounted for one to two points, although not many points but ta marking time really is more severe, less general idea points directly, please remember reading response is not really send you points. . . . 2014 fall when the class is a professor linda fang, is a Chinese prof, speak not very good, but this course exams and class is not very close contact, deepen class for reading material about the ideas of understanding, but if did not read the reading, you may experience some minor difficulties, Professor at each lesson lesson lesson will po of reading and ppt, even if not often go to school for this course will not have much impact, this course altogether there is an essay, a period, a period, before each exam will give you exam instruction, which will include exactly the same exams, so the need to carefully review the exam instruction before the test, because the test is the original title. Overall this course for Chinese students is really relatively simple, for Confucianism Taoism Buddhism that several key people have a certain understanding, but reading if you do not want to see or do not know how or if to Baidu search can be found to HowNet paper or Chinese translation. . . . For the kind of stinking dozens of pages long article useful, but for white students difficulty. . . . (Coriander face) This course reading is too large, but it will not be difficult, very difficult exam moderate, very suitable as a minor or as auxiliary br3 of major. EAS105eas103 + eas105 freshman is a required course for the Department of East Asian history, if taking into account the history of East Asian Studies, or join a complete br3 students consider take this combination. 105 inherited the workload of the Department of East Asian Studies, a not particularly large, traditional to high points, as long as the students learn the basic can 75+, 80+ seriously is very easy. The professor Schmid is Montana's Korean Studies, those phd not really teach the instructor will be better than in his class, Professor Schmid will be a reading culture behind layers of analysis, historical reasons, very exciting. This course is the amount of work (possible changes), two essay, ten times tut, several reading response (small essay) plus one final. final topic in advance will give you. EAS110EAS110 is to meet the one-year br1 lesson, it is actually Smecta language - Korean friends. In the freshman class in a variety of languages, it is relatively easy for a course. If on the Korean or South Korea with great interest, but they could not find a method of self-learning Korean freshmen who do not miss this course. This course you need to go in early September Professor Han Yu's office conducted a very brief interview, designed to detect whether you have Korean Background, in order to avoid this course students get high scores cents effortless friends. Interview you are about to teach you one of this course two prof (maybe I'll tell a couple prof is incorrect). As a zero-based Korean students, this is a good introductory course. There is a full-semester midterm, a final. But do not underestimate this course, because the weekly quiz testing, and recite the two texts; once the job twenty pages to be completed within a week, which will be counted out. Elementary grammar, writing, listening and reading are a professor, so you will be able to learn over the course of basic communication and people of Korea! NEW102H1F / NEW112H1S (travelling words) Many people believe this course is not so understanding. Xiao Bian on last semester when the class is in NEW102, and no prerequisite requirements; may this year NEW ONE department made an adjustment, it is divided into two half F and S classes: NEW102H1F and NEW112H1S, the requirements to be on the F before more than S class. This course is part of New College, but any college students can take this course. NEW ONE very many, namely: NEW101H1F / NEW111H1S (Food matters); NEW102H1F / NEW112H1S (Travelling words); NEW103H1F / NEW113H1S (Food matters); NEW104H1F / NEW114H1S (Art & Community) is a small compile Travelling words.. Travelling words focus on ""Learning without borders"", to understand how language is connected to divide the population, geography and so on. Share experiences of language learning, mutual understanding of different cultures. NEW ONE classes are in the form of a small class Seminar, each class will have a reading and discussion. No no Midterm Final, they are in accordance with the usual Participation mark, essay, diary and speech scores count the final score. There is a certain amount of reading requirements, but also require a panel discussion and cooperation. In addition to lessons in small classes every Thursday, every Friday the students have classes all NEW ONE gathered up large Seminar, sharing learning content in different units. Probably every other week on Friday will again Field trip, this is the most awaited small series it! Last year we visited a lot of community, learn about different customs and culture, and community of people to communicate, is a good way to broaden their horizons.

Scientist Stephen CookStephen Cook is known as one of the computer scientists for outstanding contributions to the theory of computational complexity. [Computational complexity theory] Computational complexity theory (Computational complexity theory) is a branch of theoretical computer science and mathematics, which uses mathematical methods for quantitative consuming calculations required resources analysis and study of various problems in the calculation of the relationship between the degree of complexity and fundamental nature, it is the theoretical basis of the analysis of algorithms. One of the results of computational complexity theory is the most prominent theory of NP-complete (NP-complete). Briefly, NP complete theory refers to a study in the complexity of the class, there may exist a ""most difficult or the most complex problems."" Stephen Cook in the establishment of the NP complete theory for the study of the relationship between the complexity of the proposed class ""complexity reduction"" (complexity reduction) is still one of the most commonly used reduction method now. On the basis of the Cook reduction on the other computer scientists have a different model defines some additional complexity reduction, for example, more than a reduction, reduction and random truth table reduction and so on. Popular little explanation, the problem Professor Cook studied computer can not solve any kind of problem. Even if not CS professional students must also understand the study for the development of computer science it has a kind of important. Speaking Professor Cook, it should be his most famous 1971 paper published in The Complexity of Theorem Proving Procedures. This paper is NP complete theory laid the foundation, but also earned him the 1982 Turing Award. [Turing Award] I believe we are not familiar with the name of Turing, yes, the name is the Turing Award from the computer science pioneer, British scientist Alan Mathison Turing. Turing Award originated in 1966, so far a total of 62 winners. Turing Award nominations without any restrictions, but the selection was very strict, only for one (or several collaborators) an achievement reward annually. Turing Award status in the computer industry is very high, is known as the ""Nobel Prize of computer science,"" the major awards. 2013, Professor Cook was awarded the Gerhard Herzberg Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering and research funding one million knife. And in this the beginning of 2016, Professor Cook has won two honors: Canadian Association of Computer Science 2016 Lifetime Achievement Award, and international awards ""BBVA foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Information and Communication Techbolodies category"". Professor Stephen Cook after he gained his MA and PhD from Harvard University, first as assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1970 came after much to teach, it has been 46 years. Not a lecture professor and can not be called a good teacher, very often a formidable scholar is not a powerful teacher. But Stephen Cook academic achievements not only deep, but also teach classes full of praise. Rate My Professor Stephen Cook on everyone evaluation of almost all despite feeling he taught undergraduate courses is one of the most difficult (this year he teaches is CSC463), professor himself was ""very approachable and helpful"", his class good harvest many. ▲ screenshot from Rate my Professor Stephen Cook, after all, is old and does not know how many years will continue to teach in the book how, after reading this presentation Have you ever wanted a little heart rub a little lesson selected Stephen the Great God Xianqi yet.

Cat slave Xiao Bian With disturbed mood in opening the next day took the small partners to go check it out. Why disturbed? Because if Xiao Bian Xiao Bian family LeBron and if found carrying it out have a cat, do not know what will be some scenes. . . . (Tracy Brain theater) TOT from the main campus is still quite recent, and very conspicuous signs. From floor to ceiling windows facing the street you can see the funny cat meow star cozy area a few people enjoying a steady stream of cat slave turns to horse slaughter. Whole cafe broadly divided into two areas, one is the ordering area, is another funny cat area. Meal area promising not want (in fact, more is still waiting in line to enter the zone funny cat) for guests to prepare small fresh wood tables and chairs. Dim light, very warm. Menu for now is not very rich, beverages mainly to provide 3-4 desserts, direct selection in the freezer is not listed in the Menu. Xiao Bian point is the Black Cat Mocha, the general taste, anyway, small series is directed to meow. Guests who want to tease the cat into the area need to register at the counter and picked up the listing and replaced before they can enter the area and funny cat funny cat meow star people dedicated zone slippers after close. Funny cat into the area there are two simple rules: 1 can not take pictures with flash; 2 can not meow picked up in order to avoid causing them to scare the guests personal safety.. In addition to funny cat meow star who offers every kind of toy, and everyone is free to play the meow Star. Currently there are five cafes meow star people, their data are posted on the wall funny cat area. Few meow star who should adopt all come. Adoption instead of buying small series have always been very supportive of. According to the owner, Gargamel is inside the most shy of a shy, small series but did not feel he was shy, as early as at the point when a single small series across the glass to see him and the crowd broke into boisterous scene, in fact, he is today small to see the most active. Yes, that's only lying to sell Meng. Xiao Bian could not go when there are three meow star people are sleeping, after a Chibaohezu also entered the lunch break, only Gargamel is still plenty of energy to play with us. While other sleep, but a small cat you go fondle their partners also do not mind, in fact, some guests are enjoying their time quietly by his side. Black Cat is a bit silly could not tell ah, but according to Xiao Bian keep LeBron small black cat years of experience is concerned, there is no mistake, then the top two being Kiana and Vinny, relatively easy-going personality, but it is not a good move. Another little black Finch is the relative lack of feeling insecure type, more than one person likes to hide little nest quietly watching you. Also, or condescending to the king exudes atmosphere overlooking the living beings. . . . Finally, feeling like a little cat Tiana signs prototype. Xiao Bian went Tiana were eating lunch, and other small series into the registration area she has begun to tease the cat nap. However, this does not prevent us close to her. Shop meow star who is said to adoption, so if we have to play the meow star who should be able to apply directly to take home. Coffee Shop is open 10 am-8pm, funny cat zone residence time normally specified 1 hour to 1.5 hours, but when Xiao Bian today to overcrowding, we can only stay for 30 minutes (totally inadequate to say). But it can repeatedly queuing and meow star people play, and there is no minimum consumption, do not buy coffee can also go directly to the registration and meow star people play. Life has so much pressure, and sometimes meow star people together basking in the sun will not know unconsciously relax a lot. A cup of coffee, a few meow, warm winter sun, how would like to think a little less of it in the afternoon.

53,                        关于「人工智能 A.I.」—— 我有故事和酒                     ,UTzhushou,微信号,http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MjAyOTEzMg==&mid=402349253&idx=1&sn=3035f6321fe96f97beebea2a3667ae6e&scene=19#wechat_redirect,"On ""AI Artificial Intelligence"" - I have the original story and wine 2016-03-08 Jesse Zhang, JUT assistant UT UT assistant assistant Micro Signal UTzhushou Features UTADA's more convenient for students to provide public I want to talk about a number of modern distance science and technology far science fiction story. Movie ""A.I: Artificial Intelligence"", there is a loved programmed robot boy David. In order to save the mother who lost a child, David entered as a substitute for a family, but gradually fell out of favor, his mother abandoned by humans. Later, he was thousands of miles across, only a desire to achieve the impossible - to become a real child, returned to the side of his beloved mother. Movies so many people stuck in my throat, not only because of human selfishness and varied, and the eternal loyalty program, but also because of the story behind, as if there are many problems humanity must face: ""? Are based on the material basis of emotion,"" ""thinking you can manually copy it? "","" when love and creativity become artificial, you'll enjoy still afraid of it?. "" Perhaps you will say, ""AI closest thing I've ever seen, nothing more than recommended commodity Taobao, Netease cloud music"" Daily Song "", at most, will be able to easily molested Siri, sometimes will deviation, these are weak artificial intelligence, from the real ability to have human AI that much difference. ""Do not judge! wish to go down to look at the technological frontier step. A month ago, google developed AlphaGo Go to defeat European champion, fell on the last human chess project; Then, there are almost perfect from google can adapt to the external environment of the robot Atlas. This may indicate a growing will, ""calculating"" in the A.I. into human life. Imagine a robot has a human appearance sitting across from you and your chess, chess can often see through your routine method, how would you feel? Follow technology news people will feel vague: artificial general intelligence has been exposed tip of the iceberg. A.I. This hot topic has provoked a lively discussion seems more than ever, the ability to limit either on ethical or on artificial intelligence. The machine can get emotional? I want to talk from the second story. I was in a bookstore reading many years ago when a science fiction novel, called ""count"", formerly known as ""Newton's New Clothes."" It talked about the future, forecasting and consulting analysis, and related occupations no longer exist. Only one called ""energy"" of the computer, it is a very powerful artificial intelligence that can calculate everything. But the end of the book, the male and female to win, because ""can"" love them can not be calculated, so that the computer can calculate the crash. Therefore, artificial intelligence, it is not the bottleneck? In the end they can not learn human feelings? However, like Helen of Troy after seeing Yang Guo suddenly understand what love is the same; as one day you see a gray-haired father felt the same guilt and sorrow and grief - the machine is difficult to obtain certain human emotions, because these emotions It looks more like a soul ""awakening"" not acquired. The machine can detect changes in your body Liheermeng, testing out your adrenaline sudden rise, it is difficult to take the initiative to produce complex and subtle human heart, indescribable emotion. But the machine can interpret a person from the big data: the human behavior through the full range of recording, after calculation, analysis, resulting in a seemingly emotional conclusion. Technically speaking, A.I. How about you exactly how to read? Today's artificial intelligence is divided into roughly three categories: classic AI (Classic AI), a simple neural network (Simple Neural Networks) and biological neural networks (Biological Neural Networks) among the most ""smart"" way is biological neural networks. (Examples of biological neural networks: Numenta manufactured Hierarchical Temporal Memory) For ease of understanding, give life example: A company would like to find hidden in the workforce of some bad employees, these employees find malicious behavior in the workplace, For example, disclosure of confidential business documents. Without employees browse mail premise, how to use A.I. know who is abusing power? ""Biological neural networks"" would get from there to every employee data (such as a file being viewed daily frequency number, mail number, etc.), and then automatically to each individual to establish ""normal state behavior norms,"" ​​a model. Then the system would be predicted from what normal behavior of each employee, what is abnormal behavior Yes. All modular computing are all done automatically, without any manual intervention. Thus, for each individual independent model, then as data changes constantly self-correct adjustment (what we call learning ability), and dynamically identify malicious employees. (Source: Jeffhawkins & Donna Dubinsky) It would appear that a pre-written program, you can follow the changes in the human make the appropriate changes, and then even have creativity. However, when such re-creativity continues to progress, even to the ""active thinking"" in height, whether brewing tragedy? I want to say third story is a microcosm of a lot about the ""A.I transgression mankind"" works. Movie ""I, ROBOT"" ( ""I, Robot"") and tells the story of one day in the future, due to the hard work of scientists, robots replaced humans do all the work. There is also a very powerful artificial intelligence VIKI help people solve analyze various problems, but after a time for self-promotion, it analyzed, and worked hard to maintain law and order, compared to save in times of crisis, imprisoned, limit human, It is the best way to ensure human reproduction. It controls all the robots eventually began a controlling human revolution. Do not rush to say that this situation can not, and do not use the robot's behavior is defined as ""unjust."" Behind this involves intelligent philosophy (Philosophy of Artificial Science) and the Philosophy of Mind (Philosophy of Mind) issue. You can try to think about the interesting question: to what extent the machine intelligence with human intelligence was equal? Machine moral, immoral, or moral, is a human problem, or AI problems, or ""we"" common problem? Since the ""morality"" is a human-defined, they can be judged by the machine do? ... ... (From """" smart ""philosophy - Man and Artificial Intelligence"") based on Turing (AM Turing, 1912-1954) in the ""MIND"" published in ""Computer and Intelligence"" (Computing Machinery and Intelligence) one article, ""Turing test"" (Turing test TT) test was used to compare the human intelligence and artificial intelligence. But in fact, ""Comparison between man and machine,"" not a problem, the problem is ""Turing test"" the test whether ""right"", and this is tantamount to man or machine ""correct"" what is .... .. Back to the science and technology fields. Technically far less people today to obscenity, ""I, Robot"" this story, how could let humans wanton development of artificial intelligence? Has long been wary of humans, you can always turn off the button in the future development of artificial intelligence. Think of cloning it. Since humans do not accidentally invented the nuclear bomb, humans have learned moderation. Just as we will not continue to study how to make a cloned person. We have to do is strive to develop, then the last step before the cliff to tighten the reins on the horse's neck. After the development of technology to a node might exponential growth, the impact of this explosive growth brought about by unpredictable, humans do not know where to stand curve. Distant future, perhaps at hand. There are a lot of stories about A.I. The human brain was wide open infinite: AI who fell in love with the owner or produce emotional, or independent thinking have launched an uprising, or even creativity has a strong productivity program replaces all apes, is even analyze heterosexual deserve heresy trial ...... that time humans may big fun. However, if there is artificial intelligence comparable to human beings that day, I would think that would not be related to A.I like horror movies. If a robot to understand human emotions at the same time there is full reason, it is more likely to be good like a spoiled dog flattering, but also as experts like sister tease capture your heart. As the ""Cyborg She"", once the AI ​​can understand human emotions, then his master becomes ""love IQ is negative,"" the state simply will not be too easy. As you can always easily from where your parents get the support and connivance of comfort, like an undercover robot is also very easy as capturing your trust. Today, we can do most want to achieve, it is to continue to make machines smarter. But do not forget - our ultimate goal is not the development of technology, but the realization of human happiness.

54,                        致所有梦想进入金融行业的多大学子，我们共勉                     ,功能介绍,UTzhushou,http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MjAyOTEzMg==&mid=205541093&idx=1&sn=dfb3d5c88c066a04df685a4b083d3546&scene=19#wechat_redirect,"To all dream of entering the financial industry, how much students, we encourage each other 2015-05-18Cheney ZUT assistant UT UT assistant assistant Micro Signal UTzhushou Features UTADA's more students to provide convenient public number before writing this, I was hesitant before. This article mainly about two points. 1. Go to the financial industry is a kind of competition 2. How can you stand out (you have to enter into concrete what club, how forward, learn a tutorial which allows you to become the year's top 1%, more than 90% of professional more professional, which read several books) introduce myself first, small Rotman freshman year, followed by the election Finance & Economics. Hold on to see here, you think, I'm a freshman in here to write such a heavy topic is how much courage ah. I say the following is not my opinion, Rotman in the first year, basic and Commerce related events I went quietly and listen, and then play my shameless sister school seniors and eloquence and the industry professional who sincerely neighborhoods, and then continue to listen. So concentrated you are listening to a lot of things after the following text summary. 1. Competition and the entire U of T reality competition extremely fierce, Rotman well. Life Science or Engineering with the power of God compared to those curriculum, Rotman academic burden in the first year is really weak burst, although two or three years will be much faster, but the burden of learning is not comparable. But Rotman more brutal competition, why? Engineering students after four years professor of destruction, after graduating basically live comfortably, Life Science University tyrants who score reaches a certain level (4.0) are not afraid. Rotman can do? 4.0 may make you get the interview, but only if you teach at school, then you have basically been eliminated. Employment Reality: If you step by step, eyes only GPA, a day will not be too concerned about Econ, it is basically out of the question, unless you have a reliable father. I teach at school, and in the interview, when the real work, accounting for 10%. Then Rotman graduates each year to find ""good job"" (in this case a large commercial bank, which is similar Analyst), 10% or less, and most hard to force investment banking, into only 3%. These are Sale side work Pinlelaoming year earned 78 thousand knives, but also so many people looting, many people say IB high salary, you first look at the people working hours a day. The real money Buy side (various fund, Private Equity, Trading), just graduated from such work Rotman received no offer of 10. We are talking about today is how to be that the 10% or 10 people. In Rotman, everyone crush contention that a few places, you have the opportunity and the people will not just utter. That is why I said before writing, in fact, I was hesitant. But another reality is more cruel, if you want to learn finance to Rotman gone wrong, this is clearly not the best choice, strong Ivey's alumni's, Bay Street 10 working almost gave Ivey8 months; Waterloo school finance has coop, there are 34 people graduate job experience, and how we compared; Queen's inside most of the rich that is expensive, TD boss's daughter is now at Queen's of Business. We are and their ratio to the last, it is not thinking about how to become a 10% Rotman, but trying to expand our market share to the 10%, that 10 people be expanded to at least 20%, 20 individuals. This is why I venture to write this reason. Typically, a general article here has come to an end, the harsh reality is analyzed, and then say that we treasure, in vain. First, the authors do not know how to do, and second, he just did not want to tell you. Well, too much nonsense, on goods. How to stand out? First, let's clarify the relationship. What we want is: how much of a Top After graduating from 1-10% of the financial work --- you must be in the top 10% before graduation internship experience + GPA to get the job that you have to have --- one of the Top 10% of the stock of knowledge + big four banking associations + GPA has got the job (preferably two) so now it is clear, if you are a student in school, no matter what science, mathematics or economics school Commerce or study philosophy, if you want to go this route finance, there are three directions can work: knowledge, community and GPA. GPA: large banks and investment banks require a relatively high yield of at least 3.5, preferably 3.7, the higher the better. A variety of buy side of the fund, like high privte equity expertise requirements, this time in the interview to show exhaustive, but GPA requirements are not so high, and seen a few went to the 2:00 a fund, but must belong to at every life, is not recommended to try. Associations: How much financial community on that plus a 4 AOU a Lab, 9 Yuefen school, managed to get into one: Rational Capital Investment Fund, FORMS, Harthouse investment Fund, PMG. Rational Capital: freshman started school, what they do to the Rotman Commerce Finance Association (RCFA) of Orientation, RCFA Rational Capital's president and chat with us, said: ""Even if I have been working so hard, I got nothing comprare to those guys. Those guys spent 6 7 hours a day reading financial reports and books, they are aiming for different level. """" Those guys ""is the Rational Capital gang was listening I was shocked. Later, know they have (1) Pre-analyst program, 30 dollars will be able to pay on time every two weeks (2) Analyst program, a total of 30 people, have to write resume, answer the eight questions in writing, interview (3) Internship program to resume, cover letter, interview. Xiao Bian now while this program three years, I can tell you about the process of how to enter. Anyway, the next semester to go (1), did not understand it does not matter, in the terms of the PPT down, for home Google, try to read the weekly Post material. Then Apply (2), to (1) clarify something, go no problem, but few people are willing to take the time to figure out. This year (2) income 5 people, small series is the only one a year, because 99% of first-year thing too big to think that what they do so on their own can not apply (3) do not apply Intern financial know that, but interested, GPA must be high, and you have to show that you really want to want to enter into the Intern, really a lot of welfare, they put you as one of us, and what you teach. Programs where not all Rotman, as well as engineering mathematics humanities. A limited number of words can not say, we are interested to go online to check, Xiao Bian next year may also go to the Pre-Analyst program, students are really interested then we will again. Several other never been, do not say too much. FORMS I am sure you all know, the rapid development of a short time, is said to have anaylst program, Harthouse also famous, but not good feed, you have to prepare, how to prepare, under stresses. PMG, 13 individual program, are wanted IB by alumni with these 13 people, known as the Rotman own fund, but there are no funds, is difficult to enter, but there are ways, under the stock of knowledge when speaking. There AOU, the company is basically how many people first intern was there. And our BMO financial lab in annual RITC of volunteer recruiting and lab assistant, usually only when the volunteer a chance when the lab assistant, but when it is difficult to enter the most important thing is knowledge reserves. Finally the stock of knowledge to this. Straight to the point. Buy a course and a pile of books. Book endless right, this door course called Breaking Into Wall Street. Video teaching, taught from scratch, think you finance do not understand anything, step by step, it is recommended to buy two things: one is Excellent with Excel, is a Financial Modeling Fundamentals. Value of this door course I can not emphasize more, Head lab assistant told me not to go to summer AOU, to learn this, you will learn to come back on the market more than 90% of the professional and more professional, you go to various community is casual abuse; we several Rational Capital of Intern this summer is to put this as the main materials. FML, I said too much.

FUT assistant UT UT assistant assistant Micro Signal UTzhushou Features UTADA's more convenient for students to provide a small number of assistant public will soon launch Raiders freshman series, including life science, for computer science, rotman commerce and other elective subjects recommendations and course descriptions, and various guidelines for living in Toronto. Mentees you have any questions you want to know, please leave a message to the assistant, you have a sister school seniors suggestion would like to mention also welcome contribution, thank you ~ Life science freshman compulsory basic course more, are all specialties except Psychology We need to learn lessons include CHM138 + CHM139 (or CHM151), BIO120 + BIO130. The mathematics and physics according to different professions have different requirements. For details, please refer to the Faculty of Arts and Science in Calendar on the official website of the professional course requirements listed below. Described in this article is Life science freshman most common basic courses, as well as suggestions for learning these courses. Chemical CHM138 Introductory Organic Chemistry two previous Term test difficulty often lower than the Final, when many of the concepts are not well understood just touch, just listen to the professor talked about class content is not enough. Fortunately, very strong chemistry textbook, must study hard. In addition you can participate in pre-class ULife or TLS organized counseling (the circumstances of juniors to know more nature, advertising everywhere before exams), there are relatively biased examination skills. Conceptual understanding need to put in place, the law of reaction to clear the memory, and remember the professor arranged after-school exercise and past tests and exams must be done. CHM139 Chemistry: Physical Principles139 mostly very simple concept, improve high school chemistry courses equivalent to summarize knowledge. It is important to figure out the concept, but requires a special memory content is not much, the examination use formulas and constants will be given. 139 involves a lot of calculations, which we need more careful when doing problems, arranged after-school professors question the focus topics are best able to practice again. 138 and 139 to choose which door? Universal is the first 139 will be relatively easy. But Xiao Bian personally is the first study 138, did not affected by anything, no matter what course to learn the effort required is the same, but we are more familiar with the 139 knowledge is good to use it. Anyway we should not underestimate the enemy, courses are easy to difficult, even when you start to feel knowledge is very simple, you can not relax oh. quiz about the experiment and quizTutorial essentially belongs to delivery points, as long as progress has been followed by a good school will have no problems. Lab of the quiz would be more attention to detail, we need to carefully prep lab manual, in addition to issues related to the experimental principle, such as how to deal with sudden emergencies such problems will be covered into the quiz being. The difficulty of the experiment itself is not large, but related tasks (prelab and lab report) can not be lazy. Biological BIO120 Adaptation and BiodiversityBIO120 may be all lifesci subjects most like a liberal arts, and in fact the course difficulty is not high, but it is a big Kaner lifesci many students encounter. This course requires the class was very focused attention, do not let any example of a professor speaking, when the review is also necessary to remember clearly the details of each variety of biological experiments, some of the same content needs to history like the back memories. Specific topic and style, we brush past exam will have the experience in this recommendation ...... ulife (remedial classes before mentioned) of Bio notes, for knowledge is very detailed summary, if there is a chance we must got review use. BIO130 Molecular and cell biology many people think that a lot of goodwill to 130 than 120, although the content is still a lot to remember, but the basic concepts related to basic high school has learned. Reading may be some pain, but also please seriously, if not also lay the foundation for the exam. To review or when the class content-focused, exam test sites involved are basically part of class the professor stressed. It is strongly recommended Prof. Yip's Vespers, professor god level you deserve. After (however small series is not elected Prof. Yip class section rub a few reasons because of the fire can not go rub ... no small partners chosen do not worry, the same can learn early lessons 130, the question of when Professor lesson sooner or later will confirm content of the examination is both involved before.) with 120, very recommended Ulife of Bio notes. On experiments and quiz experimental operation itself is not accounted for points, but personal feeling biological experiments will be more interesting than a lot of chemistry experiment. Want a good test quiz is still a need to carefully prep lab manual, remember to attention to detail. Further biological almost give away some points, such benefits do not hand us lazy, a good grasp of it! Mathematics MAT135 / 136 Calculus Calculus difficult than domestic in North America is of course much lower, MAT135 is a not how hard could get high class, but a lot more than 135 136 will be difficult for such a small series of mathematical slag it still has some challenges. Prof. Lam recommended in this class (however this sought-after professors too, the possibility of the election is not large, such as small part I, and again you fail to choose ......), Professor Lam is the topic of 135,136 people, very interesting accent Hong Kong super funny uncle, everyone says there is Lam notes do not read. But unlike biological Similarly, on Lam lesson to learn is not critical MAT135 / 136, even if you're too lazy to go to class, carefully learn the same materials to get good grades. Past tests and exams sure to brush past decade Lam of the topic and style have not changed. If you're good at math, you can choose 137, the course will involve more proof, if you can not meet the 137, then 157 to the election, small as a mathematical slag do not do more explained. Physics students elective physics professional little general professional requirements are made by selecting a mathematics and physics, so if you own math is no confidence, you can also consider learning PHY131 / 132. (However, as a basis for scientific calculus, or have a certain understanding for the better) PHY131 / 132 Introduction to Physics content is domestic junior high school physics plus some expansion, the title often simpler than a lot of middle and high school physics. If you are a domestic science background and general high physics is pretty good, then the two courses will become a major welfare pulled the GPA. 132 up a wave of school-related knowledge, here is considered to be a difficult, if you choose the 131/132, 131, after a semester of simple mechanics kinematics, 132 at the beginning of the difficulty may surprise you. But do not worry, as long as good science is still not a problem. Learning any one scientific, the most important thing is to understand the basic concepts. But if you are well in physics, want to learn professional was not any physical requirements, then Xiaobian recommend you not only for the GPA this elective course, because it was really not much new knowledge to learn (if you are a general high domestic science Health). Tuition is so expensive, valuable lessons bit to take advantage of Oh. Psychology PSY100 Introductory PsychologyPSY100 there is Psychology Neuroscience professional courses, there is no knowledge of the content itself and the difficulty, but by no means a water PSY100 lesson, you need to read the summary to remember things very much. If only as interested in Minato BR (Breadth Requirement), then we can use this course CR / NCR (counting only credits not GPA). Course psychological knowledge involved are very interesting, and many people will benefit in real life, a good school to learn absolutely no harm. If you want to get high scores in PSY100 this course is not so easy, you need to very carefully did not miss any details of the class the professor says, and remember to take notes hand cramps (not ......), while repeatedly reading knowledge points to remember. Xiao Bian personally to learn is to write a summary (This method is applicable to all of the above subjects), both for themselves sorted out a review of data, but also in the process of summarizing knowledge mastery. And BIO130 different psychological exam examination often some classes no mention of the content, so if you have read the contents of the specified class professors not talked about, it can not be considered important to pay attention not remember. (If you get on the Dr. Dolderman class, you will find that he did not even read the contents will not be involved in test exam such cases need not be frightened, Dolderman is very well-intentioned, almost every exam will to score to make adjustments and to delete inappropriate questions, of course, this is something you abused in the examination room after the ......) above is presented and recommendations on the basis of life science freshman class friends, you want to help freshmen , greatly accelerates this wish you all the best learning experience oh.

A year ago, Xiao Bian first arrived in Toronto on where to buy what the problem is simply a loss, each time you want to find someone to go buy anything ask. This article, Xiao Bian will introduce some of the more frequented Students comparison shops, their locations are mainly concentrated in the city center around the school, but also the exact location please consult Google Maps. Taking into account the needs of the majority of students, here are basically selling food, clothing, household goods stores are, if there are any special needs (such as musical instruments, electronic products, etc.) Also please give a message - while assistant in Toronto there are many life experiences sister school seniors who want to recommend what the shop, or any amendments to the information provided for in this article, please leave a message to tell us, thank you. First, we introduce a very famous luxury shops. Its decor is not luxurious, the staff are also young students, it may look very simple, but its noble connotation forced each have patronized it impressive, carrying its logo printed on bags walking in the street is a very pull the wind thing. It has a famous name: UofT Bookstore ...... Of course, the high cost of textbooks is helpless thing, students can save costs by buying used books or read e-books the way. Speaking UofT Bookstore itself encountered relatively massive discounts (such as sale March), the school logo printed buy some souvenirs or clothes is also very suitable, interested students can look at. Joke open here, let the ground dry it ~ decent western supermarkets sell Western-style main staple food, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, meat, snacks, western seasonings, semi-finished and finished products such as now. Western supermarket decoration more beautiful, more secure product quality, water and soil in the mood will be very good, but the price is generally higher, especially vegetable prices are often scared to death of the baby in order to give people a sense. Always concerned about the offer, then you can get some cheap buy good things, oh. Metro There is no need to explain too much, a 24-hour large supermarket chains in the country, there are many stores, discount merchandise with respect to Sobeys will be some more. Sobeys goods slightly less than the metro, not as aggressive discounting metro, but with student card and Air Miles card (in stores you can directly apply) can 10% discount. St. Lawrence Market, although far from the school, but as one of the landmarks in Toronto St. Lawrence Market is well worth a visit. Kocak fresh fruits and vegetables, quality meats cheeses, freshly baked bread, plus snacks stalls, will definitely make food goods linger. Chinese supermarket main sale of vegetables, fruits, meat, snack in Japan and South Korea, Chinese sauces, Chinese staple foods. Near downtown Chinatown several Chinese supermarkets, generally poor environment, but the price will be much cheaper. Here you can buy a variety of fruits and vegetables, you can also buy bread Doubao noodles make you feel warm food. If a car has time to go to the north side of a large Chinese supermarket to buy it, you can enjoy spacious and clean shopping environment, reasonable price and even complete than domestic goods, oh. Taurus City (Lucky moose) can be regarded as the most popular Chinese supermarket, than the whole of goods at reasonable prices. Location in downtown, the students go shopping very convenient. Chinese supermarket in Chinatown Chinatown on a total of three Chinese supermarkets: Owen (Oriental Harvest), Washington (Hua Sheng), Avalon (Kai Wei). Owen and Washington being separated by a road to another, from the school recently, Avalon is far from the school. Due to its geographical location, more college students to go shopping up to Washington, and small series impression is farthest away from the school Avalon lowest price, also more goods, but there is no comparison may be too specific commodity illusion. T & T Datonghua certainly never been heard of large Chinese supermarket, full of goods, some goods only here to buy. But big is not necessarily the best-known, it was generally reflect Datonghua price is slightly more expensive than several other Chinese supermarket some of the same level. Foodymart Winterthur (Dingtai, tai) Thai Chinese character generation large chain supermarkets, and Datonghua similar in nature, the price may be slightly lower than Datonghua, small shopping experience here is very good. However, this environment is good large supermarkets are far from the school, then go shopping without a car would be more difficult. Pharmacies primary sale of drugs, food, paper towels, detergent, a small amount of food, cosmetics, skin care products, toiletries and so on. Streets and alleyways is a feature of Canadian pharmacies, but not just pharmacy drugstore Oh, although the drug retail is one of its most important function, but all kinds of household items you can buy here. Shoppers drug mart most common drugmart, discount merchandise sometimes very cheap. If shoppers often buy things, shoppers optimum card can handle, you can use this card points redemption Some products do activities when the amount of points will be very high, determined to pay attention to the students to make good use of the card can be used quite optimum value oh. Shoppers addition to pharmacists responsible for prescribing drugs, as well as beauty experts responsible for recommending skin care products. Rexall pharmacy plus the entrance to Chinatown there is a great rexall, can be said to landmarks friends. Rexall scale may be slightly inferior to shoppers, but BMO Bank users, please note that with BMO's SPC card and student ID card can be discounted. (Note:. SPC card is a good thing, this is designed to give students welfare in many businesses can be discounted want BMO account students may apply to the bank to inquire about the relevant circumstances, Xiao Bian is opened a credit card to get automatic SPC card. ) Canadian Tire main tools for sale, kitchen utensils, small appliances, kitchen equipment, household department stores, household hardware, cleaning supplies, sporting goods and so on. Rumors of a spare tire Canada, life need to use a variety of tools here almost can buy, for the first time to go, then it certainly will be feeling full of goods. Although the price is not cheap, but the quality is still relatively strong. Boxing day each year around Christmas, the big discount efforts of many commodities, such as pots and pans can reach triple. Dollarama main sell stationery, household tools, a small amount of food, kitchen utensils, greeting cards, gift bags. Dollarama is what we often say that the dollar store, commodity prices generally in a knife to Mito. Although the price is relatively cheap, but the quality might not be so good. And there are some commodities down conversion, the unit price is not necessarily cheaper than other stores sell. For students, where to buy paper, the packaging would be more cost-effective stationery. Bulk Barn main rice-based sale of beans, all kinds of flour, nuts, dried fruits, baked goods, candy and other snacks. Bulk Barn is a paradise for lovers of snacks and bakery, all self-created goods are weighing ways to sell, how much you want to get. The kind of food and raw materials here is too full, and just walk around eating the goods inside the small series will feel full of happiness ... But in this small series had to remind students of food allergy must be careful that this Pickup manner likely to cause a certain mix of different foods, you may mix of allergens on KoreaTownBloor Street between harmless ingredients Koreatown, a little far away from the school. There are many Korean restaurant on the street, along with a small fruit stand, selling all kinds of berries are fresh off than the supermarket much cheaper. KTown there is a supermarket called the PAT central market, there are many Japanese and Korean ingredients, for example, you can buy a barrel of pickles ... there is a reason for this popularity lies in the supermarket, there are a small shop selling very tasty snapper burn. Winners main sale clothing, shoes, bags and daily necessities. Here monopoly Potter brand, so the price will be much cheaper than the regular price of the commodity. Winners have the patience and time for Taobao classmates slowly, because it is not very full-size poop, but you're lucky to get the price of the Heart, or pick the style is also good clothes, oh. Eaton Center main sell brand apparel, cosmetics, shoes, bags, electronic products. The only one in the city center Shopping mall, shopping mall is what we all must understand that this will not have to introduce too much. Eaton Center is open only during a holiday shopping center, there will be discounts during the holiday season, but the personal feeling with the usual difference is not great (non-holiday, when many brands still have some discounts). LCBO main sell liquor. With different domestic supermarket Canada is no alcohol sold. The LCBO liquor store is you, 19 years of age students can come here to buy wine (remember to bring good can show age identification), under 19-year-old students do not touch the wine just go look around is no problem. There a Chinatown, college park this year opened a new, if it is alcohol lovers will be here a rich variety of wine classes interesting (of course, if you love wine, small series helpless friends). Costco main sell meat, fruits and vegetables, bakery products, dairy products, food, cosmetics, clothing and so on. Membership of wholesale supermarket, various ingredients are fresh, the price is relatively cheap, but here are sold in large packaging, plus the relatively remote location, not suitable for student group daily shopping. If you have friends here have a membership card, highly recommend everyone to see where cosmetics nutrition category, as a return gift is appropriate.

Toronto time yesterday afternoon around a little, Apple held once a year, Apple's WWDC event routine at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium. Given iOS9 updates mediocre, old Macbook Pro refresh cycle deadline approaching, coupled with the recent major media predict publish content to wait on her face, WWDC opening ceremony became the focus of the masses of onlookers. First talk about WWDC conference. WWDC held once a year as Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, held annually in May and June. In accordance with the laws in previous years, Apple will be released at the conference for the next-generation platform for their own individual operating system, and then start up a public beta process three to four months. Meanwhile, Apple also introduces new features that its own device ecosystem at the conference, the conference is no exception. So then let ada Mother to tell you about the conference exactly what released. When the General Assembly beginning, Apple CEO Tim Cook to Orlando just two days before the terrorist attacks occurred expressed their views, and led the audience participants Mourning for the victims. Subsequently, Cook describes the growth and development of the Apple developer community since this year, but confessed to update the conference will be published watchOS, tvOS, OS X and iOS four platforms. watchOS 3 First watchOS introduce 3. Apple watch released a year and a half since the vast majority of people have not been able to get recognition. The main reasons are watchOS such as a new platform, Apple is still in the exploratory stage, many functions seem immature, such as application load time is too long, interactive way flawed, over-reliance on mobile phones as well as the early problems. Staff came first, the new system will allow common applications running in the background, reducing the loads and load time. Subsequently, the staff of the newly designed dial sets, including ""Yes, you read right warm miracle general facelift Minnie dial"", ""see you the day before moving much further sedentary ah do not want to fat plate movement is dead, ""and"" the hour hand points to where I'll tell you what time it is where the dial ""............ but also increased the lateral sliding switch to a different dial gestures to respond to different scenarios. It can be seen Apple's mind is very delicate (?). In addition, the new system will bring about a new handwriting input mode, supports multi-language input; a key alarm function, it is worth mentioning that in different locations for the system will automatically provide a local alarm calls, such as Hong Kong police phone becomes 999; deep breathing using the whole system to help users at the appropriate time relieve fatigue, relax. In addition, the new system for the wheelchairs to provide a new motion algorithms to track the use of different wheelchair user movement. Apple has very carefully put on a timed reminder notice from standing watch with disabilities ""Time to stand"" changed to ""Time to roll"". In recent months, Canada has just landed Apple Pay has also been upgraded to support payment within the application on your watch, (to lift a hand to buy buy buy it). tvOS Next, Apple introduced a new tvOS. The new tvOS equipped with upgraded Siri now supports more comprehensive and intelligent search. Meanwhile, Siri, users can change the channel of the completion of the operation, rather than as before each application you want to open and then find another channel. The new system also inherits a function key authorization application, rejected the application before the need to open the page to find the authorization code and then manually enter the tedious process. In addition, Apple also released a new remote control application, apple tv now includes all the features of the remote control, and also supports virtual keyboard. Apple also said, apple tv smart home will become the center of the device, with a domestic rice ""is the core router smart home"" remarks similar. By the way, the core of Google's smart home is a sound (???). macOS SierratvOS introduced after the staff to bring up one of the highlights - the new OS X. Prior to the Internet rumors Apple's upcoming OS X renamed macOS, the message on the diagram the little brother came to power soon after confirmed. Apple canceled before the two versions of the home computer operating system named after big cats tradition (estimated to be on the big names running out) in favor of California place names. Following Yosemite and El Capitan, the new system named Sierra. In the three-screen a cloud to implement the concept of the spirit in the end, macOS enhance the use of cloud storage that sync your desktop files to a different computer, and mobile phones can also access your desktop files. In addition, macOS also brought universal clipboard, copy something on the computer can be directly attached to the mobile internet. Continue Apple Pay. Now you can put your Apple one machine to take paid (not) on pos machine. macOS support payments in the webpage, implying Alipay Apple version. Describes the small features multi-window merge tabs like after, Siri was brought on macOS, the audience clapping, both inside and outside the store suddenly filled with merry atmosphere (not). After Win10 bring voice assistant Cortana desktop users, we are looking forward to Apple can do. According to reports, Siri is very powerful, support for contextual dialogue, the search results directly drag and drop, etc., and integrates semantic search Spotlight updated last year. The gray-haired Boy iOS10 then went on to explain iOS10. Major update has ten o'clock: the new lock screen, Siri, the intelligent keyboard, gallery, maps, music, news applications, smart home applications, telephony, messaging, little tiny work, thank you. [] The new lock screen lock screen swipe to the right to cancel the apples from the beginning of the first generation followed unlock features, replaced by tap the home button to unlock. Lock screen camera slide left and right sliding widgets, from the bottom up is still a control center. However, Apple seems to slightly change the style, from the notification to the menu have adopted the form of a card-type interaction. Apple's design have to say this has yet to be polished (ugly). [Siri] iOS10 of Siri to third-party applications open permissions, you can now call Siri help micro letter. (So ​​call Siri can help me write articles do? Ada Mother writes a running account a bit tired now.) Siri will be presented in the form of a card for the answer part of the question, support for a key part of the card is added to the Widgets menu. Some cards support more interaction, such as clicking directly watch the game live and so on. [Keyboard] Keyboard mainly joined the context of intelligent input suggestion, keyword into a key emoji. [Album] Photos app brings a new image recognition algorithm, with the location and other information can be automatically generated album, euphemistically called ""Memories"". Memories based on the above information generation later albums, also automatically into one video. Once innocent little girl / boy doing now automatically help you complete the album. All in all a very powerful way, the album two years ago, but Google has achieved this functionality (Google:?) [Map] maps of still only added more intelligent search recommendation. Music music, Apple redesigned a music application, summarize: posters, large pictures, the card, against humanity. ada beloved Mother ""Random All"" button missing. (Ada Mother:) [news] News Application Applications with a new design. (We do not discuss the application of a non-existent)] [smart home applications Last year, Apple released HomeKit API, providing developers with intelligent home device control interface. Smart home application provides the user with the equivalent of a centralized control application that provides different scenarios automatically combined electrical switches, mobile phones electrical control and other functions. Home application will provide the switch from the bottom-up menu species slippery operations center, access is very convenient. Of course, users can now directly call Siri switch scenes, to say good morning, Siri Siri will help you turn on the lights to pull the curtains coffee or something (you have to have equipment). [Garbage] telephony phone tag, iOS10 provide garbage phone tag (before Android app is not there, ""the phone has been marked as 10,000 people a liar"" and the like), in addition, it provides voicemail-to-text function, eliminating the need for Now the tedious steps before the user's voicemail. [News] new messaging application functionality has been significantly upgraded. Users can now send more in the form of news, such as web pages, music, videos, self-braking graph, click, handwriting, large face, transfers, scene animation (background have something to fall or something), but also reproduces before apple an interactive watch on. Sentence, ""Apple redefines the micro letter."" Finally, the staff released Swift on iPad. The first not excited, this is not what the IDE, but a children's educational software to the Swift, which is built in a variety of games presented in the form of courses, which teach children basic programming skills. Apple earlier claimed that the program has been involved in all aspects of life, programmed to start with children, and now this application is to give the equivalent of action. Recently developers tend to younger, Cook also mentioned in the beginning of this WWDC developer youngest was only nine years old, it is a very good sign. This allows Niangeng-nine ada Mother could not help but panic up. During the conference, the micro letter, led by drops in succession appeared several Chinese application, let the Chinese developers smile, coupled with frequent Cook's visit to China, Apple shares drops heavily in taxi and so on, we can see that Apple China market attention. Yes, after all, so many people do. These are the contents of the conference. what? The new Macbook Pro? I heard, and so it autumn conference.

63,                        【干货】SB打败MB？Microsoft Surface Book测评                     ,UTzhushou,微信号,http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MjAyOTEzMg==&mid=400313863&idx=1&sn=d0975a1cdeb678bebfb9fcd996ef1a75&scene=19#wechat_redirect,"[Dry] SB defeat MB? Microsoft Surface Book evaluation original 2015-11-08Justin93UT assistant UT UT assistant assistant Micro Signal UTzhushou Features UTADA facilitate the public's number is more college students October 6, 2015, Microsoft held a new conference. Compared to Apple, Microsoft's conference has always been tepid, but this is big news broke, released a variety of windows 10 devices. Which most attention is surfacebook. As a technology (si) surgery (zhai) Associations, ADA will not miss the opportunity to try a variety of black science and technology, so we bring this issue is surfacebook depth evaluation. Not much to say, first on the map! Appearance and hinge design if the surface pro like a tablet, then surfacebook appearance and 13.5-inch screen that is more close to a standard laptop. Overall, surfacebook looks quite satisfactory, but there are many bright spots, such as: due to the special extension of the hinge structure, when the notebook is closed when the sides there are still gaps. To be honest, I do not think this design how beautiful, but a later investigation, it was found that the design of Microsoft's intention: This is first of all start with the weight of surfacebook. Surfacebook total weight of 1.51 kg, wherein the plate (screen) 0.73kg, 0.78kg base, that is, the weight ratio of the screen and the base close to 1: 1, the ratio is much higher than normal notebook. Compared to conventional shaft, this particular structure can make the length of the extension of the base increases 2cm increase balance, so that the surface book can and normal notebook as a constant opening and closing angles stand on the desktop. After all keyboard base housing, in fact, the biggest difference between the surface book and surface pro is that this base, since the keyboard surface book called real keyboard (in fact, only be regarded as the surface pro type cover). Overall, surfacebook the feel of the keyboard is satisfactory, although not as good as before I used thinkpad (thinkpad keyboard feels very good indeed), but with a considerable progress compared to surface pro. In addition to feeling outside, surfacebook surface pro keyboard would also be more than one button, and that is flat eject button when you want to take down the plate when the need to press this key. Here to talk about life endurance. In light of this, when selected, we certainly are concerned about their endurance. Before discussing surfacebook of life, we take a look at its unique dual-battery design. Surfacebook put a battery on a flat where a battery placed inside the base. When in tablet mode, consumption is flat in the battery, the notebook mode, the base preferentially consumed in the battery, and then use the plate in the battery. According to the official statement, life notebook mode for 12 hours, four hours for the tablet mode, found slightly less than the official data, but, overall almost. It was noted that life in tablet mode, only four hours, why so little? Because in 13.5 inch flat plates it has been considered a great. To control the tablet weight, surfacebook only sacrifice a little plate of life, the main battery in the dock. Therefore, from the endurance it, surfacebook more suitable for it primarily when the notebook occasionally when the tablet users, rather than primarily as flat, occasionally when laptop users. Performance and then cooling performance and heat dissipation. I tested model is I5-6300U their set was, 8gb RAM, 256G SSD. Overall, and other ultra-pole of this, as part of such an arrangement is more than writing the code, play big games less configuration. I did not test this machine on the big game, but on this machine to play for half an hour of furnace slag, a bit cpu temperature test: the case of the card game itself does not appear, but the temperature is slightly higher a bit, while the fan sound began rang. So from the perspective of the game, surfacebook not too fit, but occasionally play a small game of course is no problem. Surface Pen said so much, in fact, did not address the core strengths surfacebook or surface series. Yes, that's it - I had also thought about buying macbook, but then still want to have a computer with handwritten notebook used in pdf or onenote taking notes, so the final choice of surface. Surfacebook on the surface pen with the previous generation of surface pen similar overall appearance, the main difference is that the rubber keys from the side moved to the end of the pen, to enhance the sensitivity of the pressure sensor. Overall, with the surface pen to take notes is very convenient. Of course, there are other surfacebook also some bright spots, such as with the highest support 16gb RAM, optional discrete graphics, etc., due to (mei) Room (qian) reasons, not described in detail. Overall, surfacebook although there are still some disadvantages (such as life problems tablet mode) but for everyday office for learning, be regarded as a very good product.

""Young awesome"" become final ""AI awesome"" yet? Since AlphaGo beat Fan rejoice now that is hindsight, we look at the parties before the battle of words. Kai-fu Lee answered in the know almost: the Google approach takes advantage of big data + depth of learning, and almost did not use domain knowledge of chess, so if after going up chess again, I would not be surprised. Conference Li Shishi, said he spent less than five minutes to decide to accept the challenge of the machine. It is the reason some time ago Fan Hui defeat shocked. Google invitation, I felt for a long time to prepare. If it fails, then might affect the popularity of chess, artificial intelligence can beat our word is inevitable in our lives. Chinese national chess team coach Yu Bin said: If you win a Shishi, or Fan Hui 5-0 win it is true, then I think the human machine complete victory is not far. In fact, the answer is that it's 5-0 win Fan Hui is not true. On the chess AI Undeniably, the duel of great significance. No matter which side win, we will usher in all thinking and lively discussion on the new round of artificial intelligence. It can indeed become a landmark event, so that we seem to be something missing at the same time if obtained. At the same time, we have to consider the opposite: win or lose it really so important? AI really so terrible it? Why we must take mankind and created AI pendulum in the opposite? As if life and death is the right close thing. Explore the limits of science and technology in various fields produced a new definition. Let us introduce another hot topic: Redefining on stronger faster and higher. Compared to the game such as equipment upgrades sharkskin swimsuit, and even standard stadium, racket more lightweight, more accurate timing instruments and scientific training methods and even steroids and other drugs with a pan of these science and technology for sports penetration movement both ethereal and intangible unstoppable. We refresh the limits of human record, while constantly gives new definition limits. We say AlphaGo thirty million since Yi Bureau, and mankind is it not seek solace from their tools repeatedly in chess history to surpass themselves, again and again. The purpose of this board game is to find the optimal solution, mankind lost AI is not something terrible. Science and technology so faithfully presented the results we want, and this particular use of computer technology to improve the success ratio and objective way why do they still controversial? What are we afraid of? What human fear? Every self-transcendence is the soul of tremor, we have a good surprise in the chess game artificial intelligence, it should also be extremely surprised human attitude towards artificial intelligence. Starting the tournament was undoubtedly the most exciting part of the start from the perspective of chess. We have to mention the word ""bigger picture"" (@ 09) for artificial intelligence, the chess game is the beginning of the time of senseless force. Compared to human intuitive grasp of the bigger picture is, AI over the details carefully will certainly contain its entirety of the control. When opening a high complexity of the algorithm, a large amount of data AlphaGo will bring no small pressure. AlphaGo catch mistakes stone Lee shaking reversal of the situation? According to the process of the game, then the board is divided into small portions, large-scale improved the accuracy of the algorithm in the disk after big advantage to win the details of the deal. There is a trick in which AlphaGo comeback, do not know if you've read the Xu Zhu break Jane Long chess game that section eighteen Dragon: home of the death stupid chess students then, let us have given the illusion of winning or losing, the results actually hit the face Pa Pa Pa . Let's go on out of science ELOELO rating system refers to a method of evaluation to measure the level of activity of various types of chess by the Hungarian-American physicist Arpad Elo created today is recognized as the authoritative chess Assessment Method. It is widely used in international chess, football, basketball and other sports. Online game League of Legends, World of Warcraft competitive battle system is also used within this classification system. (Wikipedia.kfd.me/zh-cn/ rating) Here's the algorithm interpretation, Arpad Elo said: players in each game's performance into a normal distribution; later Logistic Distribution generally considered more reasonable. In one game, the winning party is considered better performance, the loser is considered poor performance; if a tie, the two sides roughly the same performance. Appearing in formulas Ea / Eb player to a desired value of A / B, i.e., the probability of A / B of the player wins. When the game players A and B, the desired performance can be calculated according to the formula of two players. Ra / Rb is player A / B Current Ranking points. If a player's performance is better than expected, then the player's ranking should rise. On the contrary, if the performance not as good as expected, the ranking will drop. Sa Council for the players A score (1 or 0), K is a constant, the greater the value, the faster the score changes, the chess master usually take 16. Use this formula to calculate the level of the players after the game A Council points to finish. Also on the Logistic distribution is as follows: Fan Hui Chinese-born French occupation Go in terms of financial Sec.

Seven summer life, which one are you? UT UT assistant assistant assistant 2015-04-20CheneyUT Micro Signal UTzhushou Features UTADA's multi-university students to facilitate public No. In two weeks, we'll be the end of a brutal year of college life, and is free for 4 months summer vacation. The following 30-second Quick, Accurate test, measure your summer vacation is some kind of experience. 1. This year, what have you done? A. learn every day ah! Library ah! . (Transfer: 2) B learning ah! Associations ah! . (Transfer: 4) C basic non-hanging branches can wave the wave (transfer: 6) D basic non-hanging branches, can house the house (turn: 7). 2 Well this summer to return home? A.

Goal is clear, was to enhance the strength of the (F-type) C. Still in a relatively confused state (C) 4. States not fat fat? A. fat ah ~ (D type) B is not fat ... (turn: 5). 5. Which of the following do you think is more to enhance the professional skills? .. A. bold attempt and experience (B type) B closed-door practice and learning (F-type) C do not worry upgrade, it is best to play while learning (D type) 6 Long weekend, you usually choose:. A go to the Blue Mountains. beach town to enjoy the waves (E-type) B If any door return, repatriation wave (C type) 7 summer vacation at home or abroad:.. a return to:. (C type) B does not come home:. (G type) A. every day type: Summer School if there is no return, Summer School will become almost the only choice for everyone. There on the election 0.5 credits, 1 minute, two minutes. Once embarked on this Summer School of no return, I will not speak of thousands of knives tuition, at least half the credits you half the summer which can not go. A credit Oh, you honestly spent more throughout the summer village bar. As you learn tyrants, bent might decide not to play this summer! Which do not go! Two credit hours and you will have a sense of satisfaction, that this summer were not in vain, but at the expense of almost the entire summer, treasure. But the thought of next year's class will be a lot easier, you can see other people crying, laughing, feeling almost still worthwhile drops. B. career-oriented: 4 Months. Obviously, you belong to the career-oriented, four-month summer internship is your choice, you also know this path requires courage is selected from the Summer School can not be compared. First you have to have a resume, then go to various places Career Fair online network with people and then ask them to vote resume to you, good luck also to prepare for the interview. And about 100 parts of a cast interview will be given a chance. How many people practice this thought in mind option, but in this off resume to give up, total time less than 5 seconds. Then go to vote resume, go to Network, went to the day before the big Chinese Career Fail, right? Oh. So really ""Internship"" in almost all of the third and fourth-year graduate student, as it has to ""have to find a"" point and worried. But if you really work for, or will find very relevant professional practice, then we had an experience that, over the next year to give yourself the chance to practice much much more. Never with their freshman or sophomore or compete with the big three four as an excuse. They only than you read a couple of years, a lot like you do not have work experience, you dare to fight to allow the company to network people to see your enthusiasm, finished third or fourth grade child is definitely not a dream. Then good in 2012 are difficult to find particularly desirable practice, but try two after the third and fourth years, 1: Do you know what kind of work more suited to their comparison but he still likes. 2: With two internships to the third and fourth years, you say you are not a child of 80% of those who finished the session with no experience? Whether you are a first, second and third year, the internship should be your first choice. (Fourth year you can figure it out ...) personal favorite saying: ""The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, only this time at its best now."" You know this truth, the very few dare to take this step of the brave. C. Lang Type: 4 months to return home, doing figure you have a plan to stay in the overseas development, in fact, know more grown up returning time and opportunity is getting smaller. ""In this world, there's nothing half as pleasant as coming back home."" You know, taking advantage of my parents still young, elders are still alive, taking advantage of the summer to spend more time with them as you get older is not unique regret the decision. Later they may make a success of a lot of money, then think back, who can guarantee that when he can see it? Who can guarantee that they'll go any farther, but also be able to eat? It also makes sense to return, you may fix half credits and then return home, this would be a good choice. Just stay at home during this period there is too much time can be used, too much time is wasted easily, then you wave ah wave, which u go today, tomorrow go in hot, shopping with a friend today, tomorrow with linens stay together. Duang of about four months passed. Then you shocked, but also to go back to university to accept the hellish life. Downstairs there is the summer you can refer to a number of substantive proposals, but also suggested that, look at other types, see if you like. If you prefer, FML, to chase chant! D. Non-wave type wave like: 4 and a half months to return to play this practice is a kind of semi-intelligent person children belonging to high IQ and high rich handsome white rich beauty, well aware of the importance of practice in the resume, after returning home, come great the father took his own life for the first practice, usually the father cried, ""children grow up finally learned to work!"" then typically a few phone calls to get. Domestic internships will be a little discount, but no more than 100 times stronger! And if it is good work and many of them are more motivated, will certainly learn a lot of things, these experiences are their resume last just a piece of paper. In short, this one should be returned to their first option, especially for second grade summer vacation. E. Faces type: 4 months everywhere High (summer abroad or travel, study tours) each person's way of life is not the same, the pursuit of life, there are different views. Taking advantage of young, crazy to chant, summer vacation, stay away chanting, above which is a completely different experience. If you are traveling for 4 months, can be traveled halfway around the world, or you can get to know several different corners of the world. Wow, think about this a little fun ah. Summer Abroad reported very lucky you really wish to have fun, about as pleasant as before - you may also turn in a circle of friends burst of a junior school seniors summer tour, as reported in several European countries, each a Course, not necessarily famous university, a person, or, and ta, or girlfriends and several brothers, in various cities, watching the world while learning, what could be more tempting than this thing? This will let you experience countless others adore already, even off the lead out in the interview. F. Accumulate type: 4 months I have learned in this class who most clearly what he was doing. Not on the summer school, temporarily not looking for internships, did not intend to travel around the world and enjoy life. They know what they are missing, they know what they want, they know how many things waiting for them to dig. They will completely upgrade in four months themselves, may be their own area of ​​expertise, it may be to exercise their heart and thinking. They have their own clear plan, understand the need to sacrifice other opportunities in exchange for closed-door practice these four months. For the group of people I have no other suggestions and more particularly, after only four months to be impressive. G. disillusioned type: 4 months 4 months in the family home in the family home, you really do not have four months to do all right. There may be half a credit repair, you had to learn at home, there may be a part-time job. Rest of the time at home to see chat show, sing all right to go out to eat street food, or a good day off. Of course, four months also had a flash ... then after school I did not like what you find these four months. Those four months of study or internship tired tough battle, dashing around all over the world who, after their school do you think have the slightest remorse? Then not proud of? Yes, no one will regret they own four-month harvest and experience. Then such an item look down, not difficult to guess, H class students belonging to ""I wish I could I have done this and that"", I feel so abandoned summer is the group of students. And not difficult to guess, most of the we belong to the class H. why? Very simple, ""Peopel usually do what is easy, not what makes them happy."" See how easy play at home, ah, hot day who's gonna run around all over the world ah. God is fair, really. It is expected 80% of the options you will make. And to do so choose, to see what you asked for. Downstairs is the summer substantive recommendations, we commonly dry. Also suggested that other types look to see if there will not read your heart. If so, FML, then chase ah! Here are dry, but remember, if you do not use, is to be put dry pocket people. Learning categories: Netease open class:.

All team members are in the top investment banks, consulting, internships and four other companies are now full time office. Welcome to contact ecoprep@gmail.com with you big sister school exchange long theological discussion. ECO prep big talk of God rotman freshman Basic Course ECO100: (For ECO100Y1: Commerce must enroll in section L0101 or L0201 only.) ECO100 The key is to develop the ability to understand their own knowledge. ECO Prep suggest that you have from freshman to develop good study habits, to learn the most effective learning, to seize the key to solve the difficulty, this will benefit. Upon my honor I say, some great God who is a freshman listen to two different Section. Last semester Pesando again announced last year is the last post ECO100, the results appeared his name on the Timetable! ! It was the students good luck. In all, we believe Pesando Econ class will always be worthy of teaching the best teacher, he was the 17-year-old Harvard prodigy, his classes are also difficult to intuition and famous. In Pesando's class, study hard Intuition is definitely good to lay the foundation for the next four years. Pesando has taught more than 15 years ECO100, big sister school of theology long recommend this course must first of all they seriously consider their own summary of his class must not be distracted, and no less a lesson, taking notes at the same time in the wild to seriously consider every detail, only to really understand, in order to achieve good results. Note, however, the name of the teacher next year, in addition to Pesando, there is a TBA, meaning is not yet determined. It is possible to teach Micro Pesando only microscopic portions, and another teacher to teach part of the macro Macro. (To be officially determined) Pesando the past 15 years, the question is slightly different routine every year, only ECO100 these, more than ten years can appear different test sites, visible ""Lord Pesando"" is not casual! And Pesando itself is extremely concerned about the development of the student teacher, is a gentleman, kind. Indart was previously partner and Pesando regulars. Past Exam often reused once known, but in recent years fewer and fewer re-use, but try out new methods title. His slides content is very clear. Over the past three years to teach the Gazzale this year no longer teach ECO100, replaced by Dwayne Benjamin, a lot of seniors sister school probably unfamiliar with this name, after all, in the past five years he has not taught ECO100 (so for him the past few years Past Test can hardly reference). However, the School of Economics but Dingdingyouming Chair! He teaches graduate courses in previous years, the general, but also for students to apply for admission Econ graduate have a decisive impact. For students, the opportunity to go to be able to freshman Benjamin Pesando or this level of teacher's class, is a very rare opportunity. Once by the author and the exchange of experience Benjamin, Benjamin and students are very willing to chat and share his experience and advice. As Economics Study Centre (a day dedicated to the god of the students answering place) opened, he is also very concerned about the students' learning. In the Past Test inadequate, the best way is through the preparation and review his Homework Assignment and Tutorial, and carefully taking notes, there is a chance to go to his office hour answering. Furlong and Wolfson ECO100 has taught for many years, mainly for the Econ Major classmates. The two men teaching methods are very fixed, and is not too difficult to pick up some relatively better scores. Select Section which is not much different. Note: No matter what the election Section, will be the average of the last 67-69 minutes. Only the final total score is higher than the average of 67 points before they can successfully enter the Rotman sophomore. Please pay attention to the freshman students ECO Prep everyone home and micro-channel account ECOPrep to acquire exclusive learning Oh! RSM100RSM100 continues John.O and Michael.Khan joint teaching. This course is a management portal, which contains knowledge of all four years of commerce. It seems simple, but also led many students to learn for a long time also incomprehensible, because this course every topic can open a semester. Students can as this course overview. Exam when there is no other way, that endorsement, every concept and detail are required back very clearly. Start, when the examination was introduced short answer this part of the year, but most are still multiple choice questions. This course has been on OISE, school environment has not been very good, sometimes underground sound will be very noisy. RSM100 often is not enough to seriously study Chinese students usually do not lead to high scores, so be sure from freshman to develop good habits. MAT133: How simple math. Chinese people say there is no problem here is not to say. MAT135 / 136/137: If you want to think about the future Finance, Economics graduate, MAT133 is often not enough. Economics Specialist for students, MAT133 enough. Learning MAT135 / 137, it is to brush problems. Subject to so much, 137 will be harder, in addition to doing the title, but also to understand.

Because how big each course has a different period of time, and then at different times by different professors teach some courses due to lack of even the location can not be selected. Small series have seen some bad friends first year the election is not on their required course. In order to choose a favorite professor or avoid waste would not be elected the first semester required course, the annual rush lesson phase, competition is very fierce, almost as crazy and Spring Festival rush tickets. Serious, rosi even as much traffic crash. Finally, I wish to grab lesson well. Freshman looks hard, in fact, is the most comfortable four years of college for one year. But under normal circumstances, most people went to college after the start to relax, such as seniors me. Then relax, found in GPA accompanied duang duang duang stunts, the brush brush to go down. In this way, the only original brush can be used to divide the freshman wasted. Therefore, we entered the university in preparation waves when the waves do not fly, not next year will pay a heavy price. I know a lot of people's congresses waves too often skipped school, leading to the final course to catch up, and then rebuilt in the summer only, and therefore almost does not meet the requirements because the scores and not get into the ideal professional. correct! Important reminder, how professional is actually a sophomore before the official start of the offer to provide professional, but a reserve status. If the results do not meet the requirements and can not enter the profession, and that almost all of the more than two-year course can not be selected, which means that you want to rebuild freshman year. Detailed course descriptions already included in the foregoing I will not elaborate, small talk about his freshman choose what class. Xiao Bian is Rotman students, so definitely chose ECO100 and RSM100. Then I 3 Mathematics (133,135 / 136,137) Which is the tangled quite a long time. Finally, because I think their future will not involve higher mathematics and 133.133 chose this course useful mathematical content business schools need is introduced again, it can be said to be involved in various basic courses in business after math of. But the small or very sorry, because of limitations of 133 large, the election of 133, on the future direction of a lot of limitations. For a freshman, in fact, specialization is not good. Because no one can be sure that they really fit in one direction, so, as a quasi-junior seniors, to give you a freshman mentees advice is, ""what lessons will want to choose what class, do not confine! Great One base your future. ""in addition to required courses, I chose SPA100. This is a basic course in Spanish, used to satisfy BR1, so I did not learn too seriously, finally CR out. But learning the language is very good, because you can sometime be used to install X. For example, to see people do not say HOW ARE U, but it can be said Como esta! Secondly, because the computer can be said to be one of the general direction of the future, so I chose CSC course, I plan to take a minor degree of CSC.

The first since 2022 occurred since the whole car accident. In a fully automatic car driving downtown sudden brake failure, at full speed toward the crowd. Fully automatic car hit the crowd in front of his car and ""driver"" crashed into a roadside tree, car crash. I do not always want to have a big news like Henry Ford introduced the concern of civilian vehicles in 1908 as the focus of the 21st century all-new car since the product has become a car developers and technology enthusiasts discussion. Since the whole vision of an extremely beautiful car, no human error caused the accident, the nearest petrol ml control, the driver's hands free from the steering wheel. . . If it looks too good a thing, good untrue, then we have to seriously look at it, it would be a potential threat to find out. Death Algorithm (Death calculation program) is fully automatic car against a contradictory voice often instituted. If car trouble just mentioned did occur, it was all from vehicle mode of operation should be how to design? Whether a car should do its utmost to protect its drivers and passengers? Or for the public service, will increase the safety of society as a whole? Answer this question has obviously beyond the capacity designers or politicians, and into the realm of philosophy. Start talking about behavior in life will have to conduct, behavior is a person living in this world is all about. What is human behavior that start with? Is the will. Only if you ""want"" to do a thing, this thing will be to make it. In other words, just an extension of human behavior will. The role of behavior is the objective world and the subjective world of abstract figurative connected. Behavior and then extended forward is to use the tool when you will want to put a nail embedded in a piece of wood, but there is no hand to knock nails skills, this will be extended to the above tools you use, that is a hammer. In short, all the people around the world to make change, and will come from the instruction itself issued. Some of these commands can be accepted, while others can not, such as theft. Specifically what is acceptable and what is not, is called ethics. In summary, as a further extension of human behavior, the behavior of the whole vehicle from the track can also be used to ethical norms. In other words, we can even put aside the whole vehicle aside from the imagination of the world will become a separate collision. When ethics conclude what will be acceptable, that nature is to be acceptable from the whole vehicle drive mode. From the overall situation to consider ""big picture"" it is always used to educate people a word, as if that is the absolute truth. But this is not a little feeling of Imperial? In the field of philosophy nothing can be proved that it was not regarded as sacrosanct truth. Bentham, Mill and others in order to prove the overall situation is king, has developed a large faction of ethics, utilitarianism. The basic argument is as follows: 1: the pursuit of utility (happiness is defined as all things) is the ultimate goal of life. 2: The more utilitarian representatives of more happiness. Conclusion: all human behavior must be to maximize the overall utilitarian purpose we take a look at the premise of this argument is established, whether that is in addition to happy life can not find anything else to pursue? After much thought I think this premise is established, because it is ""necessarily correct."" Necessarily correct definition that is ""contrary to it is impossible."" We may not be happy to do their own thing? Although it seems possible, but it is not. If a person do not want to do one thing, you certainly can not do it. As mentioned earlier, the behavior is an extension of the will, as too will not think so, the behavior is unlikely to occur. Some would cite counter-examples to say ""I do not want to review it, but still you want to copy."" ""It did not want to review,"" the negative utilitarian, although is an objective reality, but ""do not want"" is relative. When you do not want to review with negative utilitarian compared with negative utilitarian hanging branches, you weigh the results would be rolled back to review, as compared with hanging branches, bringing negative review less utilitarian. When this premise is established utilitarianism seem logical to be able to become an author, human society is nothing more than a collective utility maximization as numerous independent utility will pursue a combination, the only pursuit. This logic on our car the whole case from the point of view, the whole self-preservation vehicle drivers killed more people seemingly are the only ethical behavior, because a group of people to live utilitarian than a dead person to be more negative utilitarian . Where there is such a ""write-care"" thing utilitarian arguments in the premise has been set up, but conclusions can still be knocked down. Utilitarianism to set up must first prove one thing: whether to enhance the collective utilitarian necessarily represent the personal utility upgrade? the answer is negative. Utilitarian argument does not require everyone to elevate utilitarian, it requires collective utilitarian improvement. Use a simple example, a physician to kill a man, he gave nine organ transplant patients in need of new organs. For this case, we can use ""collective social utility rose"" to describe, but do not use ""utilitarian society where everyone rose"" to describe. (With the literary utilitarianism, learn to learn martial arts will have a look that is as the flu) Why is this issue important? Because the basic utilitarian point of departure, is the largest individual lifelong pursuit of utilitarian, all acts of a person may only for their own utility services. What style I want to become a fickle utilitarian whole society service? Here utilitarianism arbitrary assumptions of the ""collective"" and ""everyone"" is one thing. Collective utilitarian utilitarian represent collective, and individual utility logically and not directly linked. Utilitarian conclusion is that this conflict can not coexist. Conclusion Although utilitarianism can be rebutted, but its premise still holds. And this premise itself can give us some answers. If a person's life can only pursue utilitarian, if that proved ""we should not be"" the question becomes meaningless it? If only one person to do everything possible to have a result that the utility would be enhanced if he had that discussion should choose a different approach make sense? Well, for example, can not someone write articles denouncing the sun immoral. This article can be written in the hype, the sun will prove to be a villain, what is the point? We can not shoot down of the sun. Therefore, as a moral theory had asked to do something fundamentally impossible to do, that it is there would be no meaning. Selfish utilitarianism got this conclusion we have found another solution, that is every man for himself. Everyone do their best to achieve their own utility maximization, that everyone, not just the collective, utilitarian also maximized. This does not mean that everyone will become criminals, because crime is not a lucrative behavior, potential danger beyond its utilitarian. Every man for himself but also to comply with the Basic Law. For example, if I see a person on the street six kidney liked, I still can not take it take it over for himself. Because renal six brought me to jail would be a negative utilitarian utilitarian overshadowed. With this theory point of view the whole case from the car, it will be obtained prior to the opposite conclusion. Every man for himself, on behalf of the whole car as an extension of self-will of the people, must also do everything possible to protect the driver of the car that will. But if the accident, the primary consideration from the whole car only at the expense of others, to protect themselves. Drawbacks and contradictions Prisoner's Dilemma man for himself has been discussed many philosophers, one of the most powerful retort is the ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" thought experiment. When Prisoner A and B at the same time were arrested and faced with the choice of the following figure. How should he choose? If both ""muffled fortune"", shut bottles, that they only take one year in prison. If one of the mutiny, and the other does not, it can be freed traitor, a good teammate to take 20 years in prison. Both are pigs as teammates had also defected, and that they both take 5 years in prison. Rebellion is the only rational choice, because mutiny guarantees that he will not take 20 years in prison. Mutiny can never be the best option. This thought experiment proved that a person's rational self-interested choices and can not bring the best results. Which in turn with the premise of the beginning of the conflict. The method is to maximize the benefits of a person not to seek maximum benefits. ""Selfish"" has become a fundamental paradox. So how to do it? Simply put, not any way. This issue has been discussed for centuries, and no political system to fully comply with certain ethical factions. But since the whole car will soon become a reality today, ethics once again into our field of vision. This article does not want to, once and for all and can not answer any questions, just want you to understand the different ethical factions have different answers. As society groups have the ability to think, we have an obligation to seriously think about these issues. As a whole come to an acceptable answer.

For different purposes and the level of detailed analysis of each Session, not sparing even the BR course, just to give you the most efficient learning program. Three curriculum, there is always a right for you. >>>> Version1 GPA normal warranty repair BR Edition From: Arie Ling for the crowd: the future direction is not particularly clear, but have confidence in mathematics, freshman want to experience a different direction different courses (different department is professor of child), However, to ensure that good-looking GPA. Elective finished map: 5.5 creditFall2016Winter 2017 freshman enrollment reason CSC108H1F L5101CS most basic programming classes, and computer programming python introduces the most basic concepts, but the relative knowledge is scattered a lot of week three classes often forget the lesson He talked about anything, so the election in the L5101 Vespers for centralized breakthrough. Although not feed 108 cs professional requirements, but nice to get 108 points, the examination is simple, is CSC148 good bedding and entry, GPA brush tool, so do not worry if graduation will be on. CSC165H1S L0101CS professional requirements into professional courses. Water is very, very water, eyes closed 90+. At the same time because it is notoriously water lesson so many other professional people will rob, it is recommended to number 7.28 first thing took this course, do not push to a second elective. Chose the winter of L0101, because D Liu teach, lecture clearly structured topic have measured. CSC148H1S L5101 TUT0201CS148 ridge CS students is the first encounter, introduces OOP and recursion, we must pay attention to, lab is very important and so came in a later time (in case ...... bed was kidnapped). Professor D Heap assignment a strange question, but choose which section to use all his problems there is no way (to find a good fly ahead of teammates is very important). It came in the evening the same reasons csc108. MAT137Y1Y L0201 TUT0302 freshman mathematics courses, calculus, & 136 Degree of Difficulty is slightly harder than MAT135, assignment focusing prove difficult but can be discussed, but the test is extremely simple! ! Because there is no complex calculations, as long as understand the principles, definitely more than 135 & 136 good to get points. (If you still do not have confidence on mathematical proof, go to the recommended curriculum version2) MAT223H1F L0201 L0201MAT223 is linear algebra, but it is not a required course for freshman CS graduation criteria in the few flood lesson is recommended freshman selected to Shuafen . MAT224H1S L0201 TUT0202MAT224 is MAT223 advanced version, pay attention to prove in the first year of the lesson is a storm. But the same can scrape together cs specialist graduation standards. 224 finished school after sophomore mathematical basis will be good, after the lesson would be easier. But it is recommended to have no confidence in mathematics students this course also into another. MAT224 better option is recommended for the second round of the election SPA100Y1Y L0101 Minato BR1 class, but he is not the water, spend time. But I can think, the big one is the easiest four years, if the freshman can not spare the time when Minato Minato BR that it? To be honest, freshman enrollment in the last four year, leaving a good lesson to get points BR is running out, so we have two options: the first option is the most difficult courses for the year after three fastest Teng years time (see version3), the second is too concentrated to give up the idea of ​​good water to overcome the most difficult to scrape off the BR1. As for why choose Spanish, French too hot freshman must not be elected, and the rest, do it to learn Latin? ECO100YIY L0301 or L5101 for Minato BR3 class, the same water that he did not spend time. Professor L0301 is the author of much of Gazzale favorite professor. Funny class can learn something. But the test was difficult! Difficult! Very strange! But every time curve (given out directly with a certain score) around 15 minutes. L5101 Wolfson Professor of examination is relatively simpler, and very recommended. >>>> Version2 simple mathematics lighthearted version From: Toniee Li for the crowd: I hope freshman easier to ensure that GPA, ensure that the inlet professional elective finished map: 5 creditFall2016Winter2017 elective reasons CSC108H1F LEC0101 & CSC148H1S LEC0101 & CSC165H1FLEC0101 Courses Arie has been said very clear. No contact with OOP and python is strongly recommended that students come into a 108 door. (There is also a sub-base of the brush excellent.) CSC108 & CSC148 chose the morning section is mainly because ... you Imagine Toronto several degrees below zero in the morning, and can hold classes and professors to interact, are super learn self-discipline Pa ah, this is a good time to discover the thigh, after all, two courses have a lot of team work is complete, reliable teammate is half the battle. MAT135H1F LEC0101 & MAT136H1S LEC0101 difference between the two courses and 137 mainly in the less prove, calculate the proportion of more difficult, a good school you will be handed in earlier that every test. MAT223H1S LEC0101 TUT0101MAT223 Arie said is also very good, it is too simple, must choose. SPA100 LEC0401, BR1 grounds TUT0301 freshman selected as defined above, (Arie said too scary ...... Do not be shocked to learn Pa) Spanish lesson regarded BR1 conscience recommended, especially a lot of contact with Spanish high school junior partner who this course is to help you fry the same old stuff. No contact with Spanish friends do not worry, as long as adhere to class and do not forget the weekly quiz (or online quiz, then Xiao Bian is often made subject to a Spanish-speaking friend to check, & Curriculum Group has a lot of resources that you know ) exam fail, this course is very easy before. (I do not know this specific syllabus but generally do not have major changes) ECO100 LEC5201BR3 basis of an economics class, if you want to economics is tasted, then it must be sure to look LEC5201, K Furlong classes. This, blonde professor Meng Meng da, him, love is not necessarily a very simple but some brutal choice. His first day of school will be a low price to sell their notes, and other section than it can spend less you have more than one hundred in the above materials. He will teach you basic economics focus, but the content does a lot less than many other section. Furlong class sharing is often all that Professor relatively high, we can weigh their own situation. Finally Tucao about Arie recommended Gazzale, pit, carefully selected, although all the professors have to say he is the highest rate of high school students an excellent, complete understanding of a lot the last curve to take 100 students, but (serious face) If you just want to Minato BR do not want to torture yourself ...... do not choose. >>>> Version3 fastest pace, the biggest challenge, quickly boarded the pinnacle of life to win the white Formica Edition From: Justin Yang for the crowd: There are basic computer or like to meet the challenge, like solving problems, I hope the same session with students phase than to have a significant advantage. Learn Pa scheme. Elective finished map: 5 creditFall2016Winter2017 elective reasons the basic idea is that, since the election less than a good freshman class would simply not on the BR, the fastest repair courses, jumping out directly on 108 148 207 next semester, 240 instead of 236 (236 transposition discretion, but the basic freshman would not be elected), so that the same term is equal to the fast six months, followed by application research, apply for an internship, the advantage is yours.

At the same time, worldwide on an unprecedented scale grand student movement has slowly begun. First of all, who is Toronto350? The Global Divestment Campaign global fossil fuel divestment movement initiated by 350.org. The name represents the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, 350 PPM is a standard of human existence, and the current content of more than 390ppm, the name of this campaign is to let everyone know moving target. University of Toronto student how to make a statement? Brief summary, the purpose of the student movement of the University of Toronto requires that the withdrawal of fossil energy companies and investment shares. (The following is the official statement and translations for interested students to read reference) Fossil Fuel Divestment fossil fuel divestment movement The Canadian government and many others around the world recognize global warming of 2˚C as the threshold at which climate change will become dangerous. Decades of scientific research clearly demonstrate acorrelation between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions into the atmosphere and the Earth's rapidly increasing surface temperature. Fossil fuel burning producesthe majority of carbon dioxide emissions caused by human activity. Currently, global fossil fuel reserves contain 2,795 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide; about five times what can be safely emitted into the atmosphere Governments around the world, including the Government of Canada will limit the risk of global warming climate change is set to 2˚C, beyond this temperature and a predetermined amount of change will sustainable human development. dangerous. In recent years, scientific studies continue to demonstrate that emissions of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is closely related to the rapid increase in surface temperature. But also difficult to find human activities related to burning fossil fuels is the main source of carbon dioxide emissions. Now, 2.795 trillion of global fossil fuel reserves can emit five times the amount of carbon dioxide in danger. (170 students and stuff of U of T march for fossil fuel divestment) Students, staff and faculty at the University of Toronto have become involved in a global campaign for public institutions to divest from fossil fuels. We have endorsed a campaign led by Toronto 350 , which calls upon the University of Toronto to do the following: University of Toronto students, faculty and staff of public institutions in response to the worldwide fossil fuel divestment movement of the joint. We support and response-related sports Toronto350 and call for the University of Toronto to the following measures:. I Make an immediatestatement of principle expressing the school's intention to divest itsdirect holdings of stock in the 200 fossil-fuel companies from around the worldwith the largest reserves; immediately determined to make the statement, serious attitude about to divest its stake in 200 companies around the world's fossil energy; ii immediately stop makingnew investments in the industry;. to immediately stop its expansion of new industrial investment projects; iii Sell its direct holdingsin the. 200 companies over five years; five years for the sale of all the company's direct holding 200;.. iv sell its stock in Royal Dutch Shell within one year within one year of the sale of the related shares of Royal Dutch Shell. (170 students and stuff of U of T march for fossil fuel divestment) other universities institutions divestment dynamic in 2012, Harvard University Students' Union denounced the school as high as $ 30.7 billion investment in fossil energy, accusing it of promoting accelerated global climate warming, which initiate a referendum and get 72% of the rate of student support. UBC Student Union at the beginning of last year, with 77% voting in favor of the rate reduction of $ 1 billion school-related investment. In early July, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC officially announced to join the ""fossil fuel divestment movement"" UNFCCC hopes to support fossil fuel divestment movement, thereby promoting this December's United Nations climate summit summit formed an efficient binding agreement. There are more than 180 cities worldwide, universities, public institutions supported from fossil fuel divestment movement. Discussion and criticism? (The following section is small tortoise personal views do not represent the position of the community) are not the wave of the divestment no precedent to follow. By divestment pressure to reach the ultimate goal of a world-class student movement, we can be traced back to the 1960's apartheid in South Africa divestment movement and the tobacco companies nineties divestment activities. But this time really on fossil energy company's divestment activities whether it can be compared with the previous two? From the perspective of content analysis divestment, contribution of fossil fuels to the development of human civilization has made absolutely positive. The question of apartheid in South Africa, as well as the negative impact of the nineties the tobacco industry has intuitively clear. From this point of view to discuss ways divestments by inciting student groups to put pressure on schools and major organizations to achieve the purpose of money, whether alone? Needless No, the game is not just a bargaining chip between the energy in various countries, but also is the cornerstone of the development of human civilization worldwide. Perhaps you will say, error-free energy, fossil wrong, after all, so many different sources of energy available. How about the truth? In recent years, new energy-related topics constantly, enduring to the exclusive forum, titillate our curiosity and expectations. However, another one a decade later, to explore with disappointments, there is no large-scale promotion may be able to replace fossil fuels and environmental energy appears. Solar energy, tidal energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and even nuclear power, atomic energy, the energy is not unfamiliar vocabulary all over the streets, become our staple, it is only gossip. Not everyone is regaling casually, then it is possible to change the status quo, to solve problems, but also to heal or contradictions between various interest groups? If regaling may not, whether through the streets in protest, denouncing divestment is both a feasible way out? We are outraged, we are filled with blood, we have the responsibility to protect the planet, we no mistake, no fossil fuels are also wrong? And we need to stand in the perspective of a rational reflection behavior? Whether this is just a worldwide environmental action, or a difficult to reach international compromise, also, or incite students rally unilateral conspiracy? What do you think? Ultimately, the point of the Go Fossil Free campaigns is not just to put money where fossil fuel companies can not use it (they know they are not up to this $ 4.65 trillion challenge). It is to make public declarations that they don 't want to be associated with such industries. --Alice Bell (writer and researcher on science, technology, and the environment) the ultimate goal of ""Go fossil Free campaigns"" movement is not just the money transferred out of fossil energy companies (knowing this second movement only for the market value of 4.65 trillion US dollars in the energy industry chain breaks against), but to express to the public and related industries to draw the line of determination. This is a sweeping global fossil fuel divestment actions in the end will be what kind of impact the global environment? We'll see. Recalling the common global concern about climate change in the historical process (the following section for interested students to consult and read), ""United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change"" in May 1992 at United Nations Headquarters in New York by the (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC) The Convention there is no obligation on the specific needs of individual provisions of the Parties bear, nor provisions of enforcement mechanisms. In this sense, the lack of legally binding convention. However, the Convention provides for mandatory emission limits set in the subsequent dependent Protocol. ""Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change"" in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan by (the ""Kyoto Protocol"") greenhouse gas emission reduction as a legal obligation of developed countries. 2007 13th General Assembly of the United Nations COP13 Climate Change (2007 United Nations Climate ChangeConference) held in Bali, Indonesia, more than 180 delegates and observers for intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations of countries participated in the meeting, adopted the Bali Roadmap. The new Protocol COP15 United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009 in Copenhagen, Denmark buddies held due between developed and developing views contradict abortion. ""Copenhagen Protocol"" is mainly on carbon dioxide emissions from various countries, the signing of the Protocol to reduce carbon dioxide emissions according to each country's GDP. December 8, 2012, held in Qatar COP18 (the 18th United Nations General Assembly on Climate Change) on the Kyoto Protocol in 2012 should be agreed to extend the maturity to 2020.

But the fly in the ointment thing, like a Yin Ji, relapse under specified conditions, is so restless people. How to describe ways to solve the problem can not be described? This article will taught you how to ""anytime, anywhere with google"". I returned home, ready to pick up the half-done project, see page there is this like this: most can not tolerate, programmers god --Stack Overflow, has become such: ""Stack Overflow requires external JavaScript from another domain, which is blocked or failed to load ""there are many similar situations, such as just want to pay a tuition fee, Scotiabank landed a full 15 minutes. So this can only sense the article, was born. Encountered such a problem can not be described, how to solve it? Surely you little expert who has his own method. Here we compiled some of the most common ""no barrier net"" approach. Solution 1 using readily available proxy server principle: The English name is a proxy server (Proxy Server), whose function is to proxy network users to obtain network information. Is simply between the user and the site you want to access the establishment of an intermediate layer, users can access the web page (fan qiang) want to access through the intermediate layer. Specifically: There are many online sites offer web proxy, we can set the proxy ip directly in the browser, but most are not stable enough, the need for frequent manual configuration is too much trouble, here recommend a good use of chrome free browser plug-in that automatically help the user to switch proxy: proxy for chrome after the installation click ""on"" science can get online! Summary: Advantages: convenient, mostly for free. Cons: First thing to say is a security issue, we can not guarantee the security of online search to the proxy server. Some malicious proxy will steal user account password even browsing history information, so remember not to pay tuition by proxy proxy. Secondly, most of the Internet is readily available proxy http / SOCKS proxy, meaning that only a partial wall. Let's say only access google browser, if you want to call google map in your app in the api to do nothing. Workaround 2 Use VPN principle: VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. In simple terms, the birth of the beginning of the VPN is to allow external network access to internal company network using, VPN do is set up a user channel connection and VPN servers, different from the proxy, this is absolutely encrypted channel, others can see only you connect the VPN, nothing else. Including your IP address and access records are strictly encrypted. Specifically: VPN mostly paid, but evil Baidu search search to VPN almost does not work, not slow, just do not support mac. After the author of numerous failed attempts, here recommend a Baidu search less but the company located in the United States VPN established companies: express VPN (for the avoidance of advertising too here not posted links) I use it to watch youtube and no Caton very moved. (Supplement a professional evaluation website vpndada.com) Summary: Pros: stable, safe and customer support. There is a VPN is a global agency, do not worry you can not call the situation google map api like. Disadvantages: a month more than a dozen knives, little expensive, the peak period will slow down. Solution 3 build your own proxy server (using AWS EC2) principle: If you do not meet the above two methods, or security still have doubts, here is a slightly higher threshold slightly more expensive but also very fun Solutions - - build your own proxy server. The specific measures Summary: Tinyproxy installed in their own Amazon ec2 server, set the proxy server address in the browser. There is provided a very detailed article, limited space we can learn on their own after school ADA community will have a corresponding workshop taught you build your own proxy. http://www.frankhq.io/blog/2012/11/14/how-to-setup-a-private-proxy-server-on-ec2-in-under-10-minutes/ advantages: absolute security, stability , a sense of accomplishment disadvantages: expensive, Amazon metered month could easily use more than 50 knife.

Then, what is the harm? In simple terms, there are two hazards: disclosure of personal information and a malicious remote control of an infected app uploads basic user information to a hacker server. Hackers could remotely operate the phone popups require users to enter a password; hacker could remotely call system or other program services, remote installation without the app store audit program, and jumps between programs remotely; call within purchase.

As the world's economic and military are ranked first in the ""Uncle Sam,"" America's every move has a global impact, it can be described as indeed affect the whole body. As a dual national heads of the US government and the US President on behalf of not only the US government policy, but also shoulder the responsibility of the United States on behalf of the country's image. Today, the old and the young assistant with everyone understand the US presidential election process, and the specific circumstances of this election. Bi-partisan politics, political parties and the US government since the beginning of 1853 and the left-wing Democratic alternation of power by the right wing of the Republican Party. Although sometimes the case a party re-election, but overall both parties shift, the leading position. On economic policy, the Republicans praised the ""small government, big capital."" That is usually a Republican administration will propose to cut taxes, abolish government control, reduce government spending policies. Overall, the economy this thing threw Adam Smith's ""invisible hand"" like, blind government intervention will only be a disservice. Republicans tend to conservatism on social values. Fresh ideas, fresh trend in the Republican Party will take some time to be accepted, such as homosexuality, marijuana legalization, affirmative action, gun control and the like. Can be said that the Republican ideology of progress ""brake."" The Democratic Party can be said that the Republican Party opposite. Philosophy in all economic, cultural, political and Republicans are singing a different tune. The Democratic Party's position is ""the people's voice"", which represents the interests of the middle class to the bottom of society, to promote ""big government to take care of people."" That is to increase government spending in order to provide social benefits, such as universal health care. Large consortia Democrats hold a conservative attitude that they must be subject to government regulation that would make a negative impact on society (see the Wall Street crash in 2008). Democrats ""Three Views"" more progress, promote social values ​​of secularism, liberalism, equal rights and so on. These values ​​will also be placed on the traditional Democratic Party ""privileged"" class opposites, for example, a ""rich man Christian"" is a relatively small chance of Democratic supporters. Every four years, the United States will hold a general election. Although the basic long as they can gasp children of US citizens can stand for election, but if the two parties came not elected microcredit almost minimal. So people first concern is a party elections in the United States before the November election ushered in the first, called ""primary election"". After winning two party candidates then represent their party and fight political opponents, try to win the general election in November (general election). 2016 Primary Election in the Primary Election, the candidates started fighting in every US state and territory. Within each state votes will be obtained as a candidate to win ""on behalf of"" (delegates), to give delegates maximum number of candidates to obtain the party nomination. Since the incumbent president two black. . . Ah is not Barack Obama, the Democratic Party, the Republican regime changed hands to the chance of a relatively large, after all, the Democratic Party has been re-elected for eight years. This year's Republican elite like to play with blood, like have election, the first time the debate within the party as much as 10 participants. Which it is generally considered promising, including former President George W. Bush's younger brother little Bush, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, as well as business people Donald Trump. (When they introduce themselves during the debate I often in two's complement their brain like a contest. ""Foshan, Ip Man"", Texas, Cruz. Well, the hole is too small make the brain.) Compared to the Democratic side under less lively debate for the first time only five candidates, and generally regarded as promising, only one former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Bernie Sanders is the end of 2015, blaze a dark horse, within a few months tied the huge gap between the polls and Clinton 60 percent. Bernie Sanders with absolute transparency and external attitude dare to challenge traditional authority, won the support of a large number of Democrats and independents. In February the first state, Iowa Primary with Hillary difference of 0.2%. So the Democratic Party since the beginning of February became a duel of two people, the other three all withdraw from the election. Unfortunately, a huge grassroots movement Sanders is still no match for the huge Democratic Party political machine behind Hillary Clinton, the last 46% of the vote defeat. One hand, traditional Republican voters for Republican candidates sophisticate who have lost appetite, bowl Xingsao Douzhi children cheer children are looking for solutions. Little Bush, Rubio such conventional candidates throughout poll rate did not reach more than 20%. In contrast Donald Trump in the polls all the way up, thrown over Cruz, Rubio, Kasich and other number one horse. To March, seven candidates will withdraw from the election, leaving only Trump, Cruz, and Kasich. In this way, Donald Trump finally with ""America first"" attitude, people outside the party's position, as well as hawkish stance has won the vote of the majority of Republican voters. He won 41 games in 56 states in the primaries. Looking to the November general election candidates of both parties have now qualify, can the situation remains uncertain. Now, if someone tells you he who was elected this year to determine that he is either stupid, or just lie to you. Writing in small series, while the gap between Clinton and polls Trump was 2.7%, within the error range. In recent months, terrorist attacks have occurred, Trump fear green, anti-immigrant and exclusive policy will increasingly be accepted. Trump supporters generally low level of education, 60% of the Trump supporters never went to college. Precisely because of this, although not withstand the scrutiny of his remarks can be welcomed in these people. Hillary Clinton is taking the ""natural"" route, that she votes the most powerful lines is ""You do not choose who you vote for me ah."" In a very long period of time, this mode is feasible. Since 1993, her children home near Bill Clinton became president, she would walk into the people's attention, visibility plays an important role in the election. Bernie Sanders now officially ""porcelain capital"" Hillary, she hopes to be able to split before the primary election of Democratic voters to unite once again, to the ""I'm not Trump"" route to win more people to vote. Finally, to say there is a little a little in this election should be concerned about, and that is Libertarian Party Gary Johnson. Since Hillary and the party Trump's support rate is not high, many people are looking for a third possibility. Gary Johnson is also like to seize this opportunity to continue to hope to get on the American political scene. After winning the Libertarian Party nomination after his speech he stated that ""this year, although when the president is unlikely, but the presidential debates should still let me go now."" While it sounds pathetic, but this is a golden opportunity for sight into the unknown for the Libertarian Party.

At that time the school's website design is hardly any listed links. At that time we, some babies, some not even born. 2000 history of the color most ""rich"" time to 2000, when the site has been completely makeover. Look at this red, yellow and blue ingenious, look at that middle touch of green, with more than a high official network, you will have full color. 2006 bells and whistles attached featureless points over five years time, we came to 2006. This version of the official website Xiaobian really shines, at first glance thought it was the old university. Campus landscape design divided by different color illegible, the color is also no obvious features. 2008 official website to UT blue 2008 version and the 2006 version uses almost the same material, a slight adjustment of the layout, the color becomes blue color theme, a lot of small series that looks comfortable. This year's highlight is the lower left corner of the familiar sign, you see it is shortness of breath, rapid heart beat, just as after the confession anxiously waiting for the other to reply? - ""Young, just check the sub-only, do not be so exaggerated."" - ""Give me a break, I've been very metaphor confession convergence, okay?""

(Following evaluation is purely personal point of view.) - University College - Address: 75 St. George Location: Morrison Hall layer (Howard Ferguson Dining Hall, referred to Fung) UC cafeteria is the only non-self-service cafeteria, long-term implementation of the ""boys a parts enough to eat, do not want to come to a ""target, service the bustling big day students. UC has five windows cafeteria, lunch and dinner there are salads, sandwiches, live frying staple food, as well as Western-style fast-food chef dishes. Each dish is priced at around five to eight knives and a speed of a few cents per annum. Medium quality of the dishes but not very stable, it really depends on good luck. Note: Please do not try looks strange dishes, repeat, please do not try looks strange dish. (Such as the Halloween special, from modeling to taste very festive) Dining Hall of the environment is very good, if you do not want to eat cafeteria, you can also buy the diner door and eaten here. Morrison Hall went to the door to find that the building had a small cafe Café Reznikoff. Café noon will sell UC chef dishes, as well as fresh packaged salads and sandwiches, sweet addiction guilty if you can buy a small dessert (here blushing recommend Cheesecake). - New College - Address: 40 Willcocks St. Toronto Location: Audrey Taylor Hall in New College ResidenceNew college cafeteria is evaluated as how many people the highest price, lunch 11 to 12 knives can enjoy a buffet if there lived in New College small partners are willing to give you a Guest pass, then will be much cheaper. New college Foreign selling Meal plan, students who come here to eat far more than the college students. Perhaps because many Chinese people, the food here is relatively Orientalism, the taste is acceptable and sometimes feel very good to eat. (Photo credit to beautiful girl photos Jesse) throughout the campus cafeteria is probably the most law-abiding here, Xiaobian generally do not know where to go to eat New. Not too remarkable, too, there is nothing to criticize Tucao. - Trinity college - Address: 6 Hoskin Avenue (Photo credit to still beautiful girl Zhang Jesse) There is rumored to wear traditional robes eating lunch 10 ~ knife, slightly cheaper than several other Dining hall number. That small series to eat Trinity had consulted a small partner, was told ""must not go on Wednesday, although other times is not good."" As for Wednesday in the end is how a small series no comment, but I can still after half of the sentence to be certified ... more unique addition to pizza, other dishes really general ... (but the sample size is only one, what conclusions are very unscientific!) Trinity cafeteria several other smaller than some kind of dishes relatively limited , but as the only known avocado Smoothie launched a canteen, the possibility of its development can not be denied. Trinity beautiful scenery, even if it does not come here to take a look around and eat is good. - Victoria College - Address: 89 Charles Street West, Burwash Dining HallVic cafeteria a little bit expensive, lunch like a knife about fourteen, but the food quality is good. Speaking of Victoria, Xiao Bian first impression is more rich whites Art, Vic home cafeteria also gives a similar feel. Style food here obviously more to white stomach, almost no Oriental dishes. Fried chicken fried potatoes, pasta What seems to be permanent, is also still want to eat healthy there Salad bar to choose from, but also there will be some Special What, in short, do not taste bad. - Chestnut Residences - Address: 89 Chestnut St. Location: Chestnut residence distant one finally comes to how best the whole mess, but its location is out of the campus. Chestnut is the headquarters of engineering student, before becoming a student dormitory Hotel. Xiao Bian here to eat breakfast and dinner, eat very satisfied every time. But friends said lived in Chestnut lunch is tragic, so far anyway, Chestnut, fellow students did not have to trek lunch. Speaking Chestnut buffet, as a student cafeteria has been considered in terms of the level of quite personal feeling than a domestic grid, ah, what to eat. Chestnut biggest feature is to select multiple: someone's home there is a canteen Main course, where prescribe; others home selling hamburgers or hot dogs, hamburgers and hot dogs sold here; even the Salad Bar has two, a self-created, and the other by the look of a high cold aunt do for you to eat. If you can live in Chestnut hooked to a small partner, after a dinner guest pass to use only less than six knives. . - St. Michael's College - Address: 81 St. Mary Street (The Canada Room) St Michael College in the eyes of small series has been a distant and mysterious presence, listening to the name seems very powerful SMC cafeteria The Canada Room, Xiao Bian also not once visited. According to SMC's junior partner description, The Canada Room players play less stable, good times and bad, like a jar of chocolate, you never know what a taste. Xiao Bian think it should not be too bad in private, wore such a name, the chefs must have great pressure, because if done unpalatable, then it may become a national humiliation ah. Innis college and not Wordsworth College Dining hall, but both have their own College nearby Café, small series will be in future articles in this series for Members.

Today to talk about the campus food court three bars. Food court is what we usually see at the mall food court, there are many stalls selling various food home. How much food court are located in three main library Robarts library, Medical Science Building and Sidney Smith. Here's more diversified charging method, cash, credit card, Flex dollars (TCard pay with student card) receives. Here add Flexible dollars, it belongs to a school meal plan, and can be purchased separately, and some college meal plan also comes with a small flex dollar. Schools can use flex dollar restaurant cafe very much, where there are several checkout can use Flex Dollar 5% discount (see below list). Period mentioned Dining Hall Dining Hall in, UC, New, and Chestnut receiving Flex Dollar, and New Chestnut with a 10% discount.

Want to buy Meal plan can go www.ueat.utoronto.ca, Koffler Student Center can also go to the Food Service Office (214 college Street, Suite 203) purchase. It should be noted that, after the payment is completed in the online office still need to receive Coupon like. Food court more suitable for lunch, afternoon closing time because earlier. In addition to the specific booth, three food court were packed sandwiches, salads, candy and beverages and the like in the sale. (Source network text, pictures of food are for reference only, deceived is not responsible) - Robarts Library - (130 St. George Street) Robarts Library, called RB, diminutive radish children, the shape is a huge turkey, listen looked very tasty. (RB:! I obviously was a proud peacock) RB Food court 2 layer is one of the largest campus, good baby who seriously study in the library can easily fill their stomachs. While the dining area has a microwave, students bring their own food can be eaten hot. Starbucks all star dad, no understanding, nothing to say. Every Final Season, caring RB Star Dad would open 24 hours, always ready to provide you with caffeine and calories to compensate for lack of sleep tired. Subway Subway everyone, no understanding, nothing to say. Ah, that is nothing to say. Bene Pasta There are freshly made pasta, you can choose the sauce, garnish, component size, the little girl could eat small parts on the full. It can not be good, but at least is warming up, like pasta, then you can still make do make do. Last year Bento Noodles newly opened small series do not eat Japanese-style stalls with udon noodles, rice bowls and a variety of lunch. Price ratio RB food court with several other little expensive, I heard the general taste. Sultan's ShawarmaShawarma is a specialty food in the Middle East, with somewhat similar to Turkish kebab made burritos. Juicy barbecue, crisp lettuce, plus a delicious salad sauce with pita rolled up it would be a simple and solid, meal, bite very satisfied. Pizza pizza Canada's most popular fast-food pizza chain, wherever can see, even a mediocre taste it. RB selling individual parts, a large iceberg, six hundred calories of heat from top to bottom. Xiaobian no love pizza, but due to participate in various activities, pizza pizza tastes basically eat the whole, and the only one that is good teriyaki chicken. Bento Sushi Canadians love to eat sushi, the streets full of sushi bars, which do not have a food court sushi counter seemed like incomplete. RB sushi counter is particularly common a chain brand, as a packaging can still taste sushi, salmon reportedly quite fresh. - Sidney Smith SID's Café - (100 St. George Street) noisy environment, furniture design strange, fairly clean, corner also has a microwave can be used, but it is far from enjoying a meal here. Bustling crowd, at noon time in order to find a seat, the difficulty level of the comparable period when Robarts Reading Room. SID's Café slightly smaller scale than RB, only four stalls. Tim Horton's native Canada (but was acquired US) coffee civilians, many of doxorubicin father and another large Second cup of coffee and a low profile close to the people. Speaking of Tim Horton's personality and characteristics, we can open a separate article to go into detail, but in view of today just inventory, as long as you know Tim Horton's: cheap coffee, French Vanilla is sweet but signs, Timbits donuts are being gouged in the middle hole (fog). Spring Rolls chain brand children spring rolls, there is a little buffet meal, and the campus was his family's snack, a total of two, respectively, in the SID's Café and Medical Science Building will soon be introduced. Typical North American-based Asian cuisine, classic dishes broccoli fried everything. Many different types of dishes, there is a special offer every day. Not good to eat, but fans of the captain of many people, you probably just do not want it cold moderate dining car. Next meal window has Spring Rolls to go, is already packed lunch, anxious and do not care to eat a meal of what students can carry on the go, eliminating the trouble of queuing (or the money to pay for, ah.) Tortillas here to sell Mexican food, there Burrito (burritos), Burrito bowl (burrito minus the cake), taco salad (Burrito bowl of rice becomes lettuce) as well as Nacho (looks like a little taste of corn chips). Burrito is another popular Canadian foods, pizza roll classic with rice, cheese, meat, refried beans and whole wheat or refined face, of course, can be rolled vegetable roll sweet potato or something. Tortillas and not very authentic, but relatively healthy. Here are delicious meat, simmer until soft rotten taste is enough. Xiao Bian selfishness recommend Taco salad, lettuce BEDDING, topped with corn, meat (or grilled vegetables), beans, salsa sauce made of delicious without the burden Yeah, girl Come and eat. Gourmet Burgers This means hamburgers French fries, small it has no interest. Canadian beef is good, there are some very awesome burger, but the burger on campus do not expect everyone how good a. This may be too reactive type of it, it seems not very high popularity. - Medical Science Building - (1 King's College Circle) Medical Science Building, Chinese students used to call MS, Canadian students used to call MSB (please read aloud again, ""hey what love SPINNER""). Due to geographic reasons, there will be caring mostly Life Sci students. Starbucks all star dad Again. Spring Rolls North Asian cuisine Again. Sultan's Shawarma barbecue Again. Not Just GreensNot Just Green, not just graze. This is a choice of salads, custom designed for the delicate beauty sister for lunch. This salad from a variety of point of view is very general, but the option is fairly diverse. Note, please choose carefully Pita, imagine what a meal before they cool and dry bread sandwiched leaves what tastes. Soup! If you prefer a light diet, drink a bowl of hot soup in the cold winter days warm up it. You can choose vegetables, protein, the staple food, accompanied by a soup (soup salty, Kouqing and students can choose chicken without Salt and pepper). Nutritional concerns may have heard of a small partner network red super foods Quinoa (Quinoa) and kale (Kale), Soup has provided Oh. Stone Oven Pizzeria boxed takeaway pizza and calzone. Calzone is called folded baked pizza (commonly known as the hard-baking pies). Xiao Bian tried once, when the last few, there has been cold, so the next port moment to think of the rock cake skin. Artifact molars, masseter muscle exercise, cold food the best. Today's inventory friends on here, next we'll take you to see every corner of the campus Cafe are, some of which there is no lack of warmth or some little quiet it.

(Tracy: Department of Mathematics, please give some dignity), despite some strengthening of proof, the job also little changed difficult, but the test will have different degrees of curve (not very good to take care of some of the students), if a little hard 4.0 is not a problem. in contrast with the relatively simple algebra class MAT240, MAT247 a little harder and requires some effort, but Do not worry, after all curve. strongly recommended for mathematics are interested and want to choose or spe mathematics major students taking this course .CSC108 CSC148 and the language used is python, CSC108 more emphasis on basic grammar and applications, and more focused CSC148 simple data structures and program logic.

This course focuses on the design of program structure, agile development and teamwork, a substantial increase in the amount of code, a person can be very difficult to turn the tide. This course from 2014 Andrews joined the program, according to the needs of the job is to write a mobile application Andrews, although the difficulty is not high, but it is suitable as a software engineer and a mobile terminal software development entry point. CSC236 / 240 calculate the theoretical entry CSC236 is a theory, about the content is an upgraded version CSC165, covering include Induction, Finite State Machine and Formal Languages. And CSC207 contrast, this course in favor of the theory, and not related to a specific programming. CSC240 word is finished a semester CSC165 + CSC236 content, but also then add some content, although more studies but does not say it like CSC165 and CSC236 too thin. If you want to lay the foundation for the theory of the computer, then it is recommended that the CSC165 + CSC236. The important thing to say three times: CSC240 carefully choose! CSC240 carefully choose! CSC240 carefully choose! CSC258 organization What is a computer hardware course introduction, classroom content focused on a variety of hardware working principle and structure, Lab and Project focuses on hardware programming. This lesson will consume a lot of time, we do not recommend this course requires a lot of time and the same lesson CSC209, CSC263, etc. in the same semester. Recommendations in the summer or in the class have CSC207 or CSC236 time off. From general terms, the difficulty of the course exam is not large, although the Lab consume a lot of time, but also a need to learn and do not feel the same as Python and Java language Verilog, but as long as the basic time spent can score all Lab even out. Seriously do Lab class can still get a very satisfactory score. Hardware does not like the students may feel a little hard, you can find a friend like this area with the team Lab, the two complement each other more efficient. CSC209 software tools and system programming This course is the starting point for system programming, which describes the Terminal (Bash) on the basis of use, as well as C programming language. Based on personal experience, Bash is a very useful addition to IDE, the most commonly used is BASH, either git, svn or simply copy copy, and even server detection, requires the use of BASH. C, as a very classic programming language, closer to the bottom of the running logic clearer, 4 Assignments progressively, can be said to want the students to develop the operating system opens up a new door for want of repair Specialist students, this course is the only junior Specialist II Prerequisite CSC369 one required course, but this course is the foundation. CSC263 / 265 data structural analysis of both private course that is a top priority in the computer course at the end of sophomore year to juniors and seniors more in-depth study has played a very important role nexus. This course introduces the ""Introduction to Algorithms"" ( ""Introduction to Algorithm"", often nicknamed professor CLRS) in the first half, very classic algorithms and data structures, involving mainly include heap, binary search tree, AVL tree , amortized analysis, minimal spanning tree, and so on. The job usually extended and supplemental course content but also let you use very rewarding. Whether you want the students to the theory or the code of agricultural development direction, the content of this course is introduced very practical. Many companies also mentioned in the interview part of the course in the study. Recommendations on this course the students have to read more books, this course really understand, so that future learning to cope. For CSC265H, the difficulty of the course has gone beyond the level of ordinary people can imagine, unless you are on the CSC240 and have achieved good results and be sure not to try, do not try, do not try this course! ! MAT223 Linear Algebra Linear Algebra completion of this course will have the most basic understanding. Specialist compulsory individual can feel it in the fall freshman, and other multi-trim math, such as MAT224 and MAT235. Linear Algebra almost every arena in every field of computers, learn the future can reduce a lot of unnecessary trouble, required course This lesson is a lot of big three four computers. STA247 / 255/257 was completed this course will have the most basic understanding of statistics. Specialist and Major is compulsory, speaking on the basis of statistics, probability and involve various distributions. STA247 if previous years are a Jordanian uncle Lu love teaching, although a bit heavy accent, but he slides is still very good, just go to class and complete the recommended topics can be made to do a very good score. This lesson will teach a common statistical language R, although the examination test, but there will be a new world open feeling. STA255 not very recommended, as compared to two additional, Prerequisite need also a need for additional statistical lesson: STA220 or STA221, and on the completion of this lesson STA248 also a little difficult, because there is the Web and Internet Technologies Focus compulsory STA248, but the lesson is and Exclusion relations. STA257 words, although the ratio STA247 to be difficult, but many programs require proof of logical thinking part actually closer to the computer, but also compared to STA247, STA257 is a lot more advanced STA Prerequisite courses. CSC309 network programming this lesson is talking about web design, mainly about HTML, Javascript. This lesson, though not compulsory computer, but it is a very interesting and practical courses, and only Prerequisite CSC209. Learn, half the ability to make their own personal website. All in all is a deep work with the name of conscience lesson. CSC343 database entry in the third-year CS course of a relatively simple course, with respect to various other junior class (required CSC209, CSC263 and CSC258 them one to two) This course requires only a freshman mathematics and CSC207, so according to the normal schedule (End CSC207 last semester sophomore), although the junior class but can be more than a sophomore next semester. Introduced Rational Algebra, Standard Query Language (SQL), the use and design of XML and databases, but also very practical algorithms and mathematical skills almost no requirements. CSC369 CSC209 operating system upgrade, about the operating system principles, and CSC209, just as with the C language homework. Course extremely difficult, and requires a lot of time. Specialist is compulsory (Major is not compulsory), originally Specialist many students because such a lesson and turn into Major, but do not panic, as long as the class seriously, seriously do Assignment can not get poor results. Is a need to understand and a lot of code to write programs. It is strongly recommended not on together and CSC373. CSC373 algorithm design and complexity analysis of this lesson is an upgraded version CSC263, and is compulsory Specialist, talking about the ""Introduction to Algorithms"" ( ""Introduction to Algorithm"") in the second half of the specific content including Greedy Algorithm, Single-Source Shortest Path, All-Pairs Shortest Path, Dynamic Programming, Maximum Flow, Linear Programming, NP-Completeness and Approximation Algorithm. It is strongly recommended not on together and CSC369. In fact, CS learning more focused way of thinking and problem solving, rather than to make money just learn a few programming language. Programming languages ​​always upgrading, under a code farming can replace another, but the way of thinking can not be replaced, so a good way of thinking that allows you to stand higher and see farther. Finally, say a few words: learning computer must live within its means, not because of personal recommendation or 'learn more What's wrong with' went far beyond their ability to choose the course, to learn more of course not wrong, but it is based can learn understanding based on the understanding of a problem, what is more to learn? There are aspects of cooperation and teamwork than to live pennies each do a little, but should really be involved, participate in the discussion and modification, to understand why such a design program, so the operation of the code, or the job is completed on the surface of the well, to the test, as well as the company's interview will realize their true enough. Recommends that each semester one to two CSC course, contain no more than three, because the amount of work CSC lesson is almost half times to twice that of other courses, more than three words, unless it is super god, if not sleeping entertainment, scores difficult to achieve their expectations.

Which country has the annoying interests highway 2015-05-19 ask it UT Helper UT Helper UT assistant Micro Signal UTzhushou Features UTADA's multi-university students to facilitate public numbers this weekend, to see the Na Ying Xiao Bian in concert on the road the first Uber experience their own. Driver uncle asked with interest, ""Where are you from,"" ""Quo Vadis"" and other esoteric philosophical problems (strange). Impressed when it comes to returning to his feeling ""my country is destoryed"", originally from Afghanistan's neighbors to flee to this. In short, uber in the eyes of small series is still very convenient, but ""first experience"" did not have time to fill before the promo code free 20 little depressed. We also want to try uber, you can fill in small series of promo code ""od0uw"" I have let you get a chance to reduce 20 ~ ""Students, you have heard of Amway Why?"" Since the $ 40 billion valuation announcement , Uber has been in a variety of ways to attract attention; however, the present, in various parts of China, India, Europe, the United States and Canada, Uber are constantly and local governments pull (si) Paper (bi); while in Toronto , this story may soon wrangling will usher in a key node. In fact, since Uber stationed in Toronto since 2012, City Council on conducted numerous meetings, debates and so on. 2014 February, CityCouncil passed a motion one for the current taxi license system overhaul, but by and large outcry guild taxi company, and in January 2015, the Ontario Superior Court was dismissed. PS In short, support and promote Uber license reform are the same people; to be hurt Uber and the reform also hurt the same people. During this period, the city government in mid-November 2014 to the High Court for a ban on Uber, first Court Hearing postponed to June 1, 2015 were a period of three days. May 4, Uber's UberTaxi announced that it would apply for taxi licenses. (But not on Uber's UberSUV and UberBlack limo license application, and UberX and UberXL no existing category can apply for a license.) May 5 CityCouncil passed a motion: all decisions concerning the restructuring of the taxi industry, will It will be postponed to the first hearing before the court to make. May 6, Mr Karygiannis put forward a new motion: to prohibit any use UberX government employment services, and forces the Uber of APP unloaded from the government issued to employees of the phone. On the same day, Uber held a protest march in front of City Hall Nathan Phillips Square. In fact, around saying Uber parties it is very interesting. (Uber, government, taxi companies for the time being the focus of our attention.) The next step on how to do this are the ""Office"", ""talk about"" two factions. Office, referring to support a permanent ban Uber service, to do him out. This party by the actual benefits, belong to the linkage drama very traditional industry has traditionally -lobby- between politicians. Talk, it is the parties to negotiate for the current dispute to find a good way out. Supporters of the party except Uber also mayor (or citizens); but only to talk about a word, look and ""drag"" and some are too ambiguous. As for the talk in the end whether to do it, in the eyes of many, it can not depend on the final implementation of the above regulations - to develop new norms. ---- Do ---- Uber's rise, of course, hurt the interests of the traditional taxi industry. And they (on the table) attack Uber main reason is that the Uber driver safety insurance and qualifications has a serious security risk. Government support among parliamentarians and their institutions (or that they support Members more properly?) In addition to this also points Uber on the service does not match the existing laws or regulations or violation; and the beginning of March ""Snow ball action ""(Toronto imagination are not cold yet ...) in. Toronto police within three days punished 11 UberX drivers. After the City of Tornto injunction filed an application to the High Court, Toronto Licensing and Standards Committee (MLS) of the Executive Director indicated that, Uber's operations has long been a disregard for existing rules and regulations, passengers and the driver himself there is a huge security risk. She will describe the behavior of Uber is ""flagrant disregard"" **, ""a jeopardize of public safety"" and even ""ridiculous"" **. There is a similar previously mentioned Mr Karygiannis (Ward 39 Coun.). He said that if the government when the government employees with the allotted phone call Uber service to attend Parliament, and in this way accidental injury accident, injury because the Government will make the appropriate compensation, which is to spend taxpayers' money . So, first of all government employees should not use this unlicensed uninsured operational tools. (Of course, the government has allotted a monthly 12,000 mobile phones to move through about once it is there will be a considerable cost.) ---- ---- On Uber certainly is not alone. Canada's Competition Bureau (Bureau of Competition) would suggest that you have had in 14 years in November prudent decision, thinking of this innovative business models directly prohibit annihilation if necessary. Former Foreign Minister John Baird is directly on the live-tweet their results go to the meeting 75 minutes + N phone hit (formal) taxi pomp, attracted users around views Like applauded. Of course, they decided to Toronto City Hall and the Ontario Court of Justice does not play a direct role. Next, the theory is not directly affect the court decision, but the contrast will Heavyweight point: Toronto's new mayor John Tory. Basically he's complaining repeatedly since he took office over Uber things; most simply, he said, ""Uber is here to stay.""; A little more complicated, he initiated the government, the taxi industry and Uber and other consultations, seek coexistence way; and the mayor believe that in this era of government must be found to accommodate technological innovation companies modes; and about the City of Toronto to the request of the Court, the mayor's position is even more radical one o'clock; to seek the court's decision is valid Tory way to solve the problem indicates that there is questioned because the process takes time and money are enormous. The mayor's remarks getting mad a Cantonese: Mammoliti (Ward 7 Coun who previously was a member of the same liscene committe of.); He will be the mayor of some of the (public) statements jurisdiction described as interference and profane, and to postpone the decision about the taxi industry's motion expressed disappointment with the previously mentioned (the Tory motion is proposed). Although many, but specifically how to talk about Tory's words, and how he did not talk about cooperation. Of course, the general manager of Uber Canada has long said he did not intend to give up the Canadian market, so this move is more licensing application called ""on the slope under the donkey."" Earlier Uber in the face of non-compliance with the relevant provisions of the taxi industry, the industry has been using ""We are technology companies rather than a taxi company"" argument, and May 4 Uber directly UberTaxi statement will submit an application for a taxi license, specifically He said, ""this application is Uber cooperation coexist reflect sincerity"", and expressed the hope that we talk together to solve problems, to build a more rational and intelligent (smart) systems. (Uber team hired two people two days, was dug up was a member of the Tory mayor campaign team.) Just the last one, in response to the mayor said that private thought (imply) the existing rules is relatively backward, not compatible with rapid absorption of emerging technology companies, how much is directed at the Licensing and standards Committee (MLS) to go. And who said before ExecutiveDirector MLS is so response: applications we receive, we will press processes and procedures. But we just put him as a application, nomore no less, and some did not so much). Of course side of the car taxi companies also have two big brothers in CP24 table of the state. Co-opTaxi the CEO (looked like a crafty old traveler does not slip autumn) heard that Uber Shen license to say: Hallelujah! We are not Uber powder, but was glad to see they are willing to admit that he is a taxi company, Uber welcome to join our family, and thank the efforts of the mayor; the parties now have the basis for a further conversation. Buddist a turn and then they start self-touted: the words we say Uber technology companies, in fact, Men Co-op it is keeping with the times, such as three years ago, we launched its own app or something. (With our northern dialect, the fat belongs to the net, said piece children soup words) BeckTaxi of operationsmanager it is also straightforward than the MLS's head: In fact, Uber is PR regressed (that white is able to flicker); they have to package a RideSharing out , in fact, in the flicker consumers. Their actual nature or commercial carrier; to say a little more detail, is not on the commercial insurance with a private car commercial carrier, so apply for a license does not change the nature of the problem. The parties should be said about the Tory talks, she is even more unhappy that legal compliance with taxi companies should never have more than two years Uber illegal operators together to discuss solutions. ---- ---- Government regulations, taxi companies (and their associations and lobby) and Uber said is in full swing; relatively speaking, people are more inclined to leave Uber-- more convenient and cheaper services. ""Academia"" point of view it appears that high B cells. Mowat Center is an independent subsidiary of the Institute of Public Administration how they handle three long SunilJohal Airbnb and Uber said lead author shared economic times is the trend, and ultimately inevitable. And on Uber, he said the government should do now is to establish the new system as soon as possible to manage these businesses. (In fact, this is the Tory idea that nice little nothing.) An assistant professor at Ryerson Business School as saying there would particularly direct, estimated taxi bosses to give gas mask: the so-called Creativedestruction, get rid of the old new , waves pushed before the waves is the core of entrepreneurship. However, it does not end. . . . . Actually, now we have a group of people I never talk about: the drivers. The reason why you do not want on the front, for two reasons. First, because of the emergence on the driver reported the story were a little too emotional, or too much like PR war tool. Support Uber and change existing license regime camp in march 6th among the third world countries to include immigrants in Toronto is difficult to find work, until it became Uber driver to life story. The existing license system supporters, the multi-use license update system, is likely to harm those ""widows, veterans and grandchildren"" (for example, a husband by death, accident or disease can not continue driving, his wife inherited the license and responsibility of supporting the family. the new license system might allow them to have to sell this license.) another reason is ultimately affect the driver's license system in the end will not reform, and when reform (the newspaper said it would license from the big boss his hand back to back drivers are better, but I understand it is not showing utter). Although Uber events are important potential fuse, but the core of the problem lies with the driver license reform itself, rather than simply Uber, the theme has been so tricky question, it does not elaborate.

ANT100Y1 (0.5br3 + 0.5br4) Introduction to Anthropology [48L / 12T] ANT100 is rare to meet half br3 and br4 freshman class. ANT100 divided into four parts, biological Anthropology, archaeological Anthropology, socio-cultural Anthropology, and linguistic Anthropology namely: Evolutionary Anthropology: biological knowledge of human evolution behind (Eg Natural Selection) + becomes difficult journey from Homo sapiens primates archaeological anthropology: how to analyze traces of prehistoric humans work and they use (play) with the history of the development of language, social anthropology: the difference between reality and the truth, the reason for the development of human mankind (language, religion, civilization ) three professors teach different chapter, each chapter will need to use different books (bookstore Yao face). tut once every two weeks, in part in group discussions conducted lecture will be reinforced, for example, ancient tools, skull classification attendance accounted for 12% of the tut is exceptionally pleasant examinations twice a year altogether, all kinds of questions choice a thousand words essay is done in three steps (Draft took part) (in general, the amount of small task) in this small series is recommended that this lesson ncr, do not let this course gpa drag. AST101H1 (br5) The Sun and Its Neighbours [24L / 12T] to know why on earth in winter and in summer it (that the earth and the sun, far and near, please bypass), there is an ebb and flow to know why on earth do you know where the moon where to go to turn it? If you think these questions are interesting, then you must not miss the ast101. Simply put, this is a non-science of astronomy. Here's how the most popular teacher, most people use class time iclicker, and most romantic project (shooting stars the moon). Xiao Bian think, though br5 course for good mathematics and the Chinese people are not scarce, but ast101 as an interesting lesson, as might try. PSY100H1 (br2) Introductory Psychology [36L] psy100 is an introductory psychology course, and this course eco100 tied for BR favorite. Topics include physical, learning, cognition, motivation, development, personality, abnormal behavior and social psychology. Although this course read something a little more, but the thought is not difficult, you can learn a lot of knowledge of life, but there are bonus points for like cranky crowd every day. Classroom is quite interesting, such as a lovely professor once took Wang to the classroom. Students interested in psychology can try. EAS103H1 (br3) Premodern East Asia [24L / 12T] EAS103 East Asian history freshman courses, half lesson br3. This course focuses on the three East Asian countries in the history of pre-modern1800, the period involved Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, three text development, evolution myth, ideology, cultural dissemination. This course exams and class is not very close contact, classes for reading can deepen understanding of the material inside the idea, but if you did not read the reading, you may encounter some small difficulties, a professor after class each lesson following section will po Course reading and ppt, even if not often go to school for this course will not have much impact. In previous years, a total of an essay, a period, a period, before each exam will give you exam instruction, which will include exactly the same test questions, it is necessary to carefully review before the exam. Overall this course for Chinese students is really relatively simple, for Confucianism Taoism Buddhism that several key people have a certain understanding, but reading if you do not want to see or do not know how or if to Baidu search can be found to HowNet paper or Chinese translation. Overall very suitable as a minor or as auxiliary br3 of major. NEW102H1F / NEW112H1S (br3) Travelling Words Many people believe this course is not so understanding.

Difficulty and burden of each course are not the same, so we must try to choose topics of interest, especially for students like the small class teaching, do not miss the opportunity once a week with professors and classmates close discussion.

Domestic smart phone you want to know all the original 2016-07-05feanorUT assistant UT UT assistant assistant Micro Signal UTzhushou Features UTADA's more students to provide convenient public research firm DigitimesResearch number called, Chinese enterprises in the first quarter of 2016 worldwide supply 128.6 million smart phones, accounting for 41.5% of total global shipments, shipments of more than Apple and Samsung. In the business circle, blue ocean refer untapped emerging industries, the Red Sea refers to the highly competitive mature industries, while China's smart phone market because competition is too cruel, been dubbed the ""sea of ​​blood."" How in the end the price war exaggeration? Seconds to look at the market second day of thousand Yuan machine-made, we know that it is no wonder a public Tuoliaokuzi domestic manufacturers have developed around the Indian market, but also the last year before the birth of the Internet Divine Comedy ""Are you Okay?"" And with this iphone we have to do? Whether it is to buy domestically produced spare intelligent machines as an emergency situation, or to the elderly at home as a smart Internet portal, are cheap options. More importantly, if the future to return to join the tide of the Internet business, understand their users' terminals will be indispensable. Who? Operation era four kings ""China cool linked"" refers to the previous years, most of the channel operators to master the times, relying on custom machine and operator subsidies earn pours of four traditional cell phone manufacturers: ZTE, Huawei, Cool, Lenovo. In recent years because of the impact of slow Internet brand and their own transformation, ""China cool Alliance"" has gradually disintegrated, Huawei a dominant in 15 years has become a leading brand in the domestic mobile phone, Lenovo acquired the Moto rely on overseas markets barely a second, As ZTE and Cool Well, cheap mobile phones still occupy a great share, but woeful. Blue and Green Plant ""where no point where"" backgammon system in the smart phone era once again angry, blue green factory plant oppo vivo respectively from main camera and music and fortune, to rely on overwhelming television advertising and celebrity endorsements (tfboy etc.) consolidation of brand awareness. In 2016 online sales channels weakening offline channels increasingly important trend, with the Department of backgammon common shareholders to squeeze into the blue-green Plant successful domestic mobile phone shipments twenty-three, so many ridiculed them as ""plant sister phone, ""the stunned onlookers. Internet brand millet in 2010 completely changed the entire incoming Chinese smartphone market, from cost-effective online marketing and has become the main theme of the next few years, millet also $ 46 billion valuation to become second only to the world's second largest venture uber the company. Step into the market earlier than millet, mp3 manufacturer Meizu born Ali also get a sudden burst after injection last year, from the original small and beautiful niche brand into a conference last January strong growth yunos Lord. After this red and blue enemies, the main cost of the brand and young people also have sprung up, known as Jia Yueting losing music, as the phone, Zhou Hongwei daily and 360 people forced to tear the phone, Overheating hammer, oppo a subsidiary of a Canadian Huawei glory cards, cards ZTE nubia, cards Cool Great God, Lenovo cards zuk, staged a good Macabre. Who? Unfortunately, almost every domestic intelligence machine manufacturers are full of groove points. Monkey monkey millet phone marketing stunt fame, draws hungry marketing apple iphone4 era taken in and magnify. When millet launch a new machine, this phone tend to have similar price spike the market all the products, but to really buy this phone is difficult. Because at this stage, millet hardware is extremely meager profits or even losing money, but in order to maintain high popularity and topics batches sold a small amount of mobile phones. Until a few months later processing hardware cost reduction, millet will be a large number of shipments. One example is the millet 5 February this year on sale, did not realize until today and enjoy high version version of the stock sale. Lei Jun ""Ray Monkey King"" title resulting. It is vomiting blood, other domestic manufacturers saw this trick be useful, also flew up off now, Meizu new machines often have to increase in order to buy two or three hundred, more music, as the phone is released ppt (within three months of the fundamental see video) is known. Whether it is known as one million plus or engage in a spot monkey zuk, in contrast to when you finally pick up the phone after some satisfied, the purchase page out of the ""Three weeks after the delivery,"" Do not be surprised. Ads with millet cost is known, so profit margins are too low down how to do? Only playing his own doctrine huge amount of users, now is not the original hot MIUI brush machine UI, and each interface are filled with people do not beware of proof ""guess you like"" advertising, MIUI was all dubbed ADUI Fortunately other manufacturers scale is not big enough, yet to follow suit to their systems plus advertisements. In addition to the dregs of the earth UI UI started millet and Meizu two, most of the domestic manufacturers of UI design qualities are called to Andrews humiliation. Mimic the native style of a hydrogenation OS is missing too many features, excellent quality hardware Huawei software investment but worrying, not to mention the other manufacturers in order to push the new machine and rush out of the UI. Fundamentally, the Google service in the country banned lead to fragmentation of the domestic mobile phone too serious, but also further weakened the domestic ios Andrews for competitiveness. Black side of the existence of black edges of the screen to prevent light leakage, mostly domestic firms in this regard technology, however, made out of very thick black border is very organoleptic phone. The so-called ""black side can stop the aircraft carrier"" is also popular moment. Some unscrupulous manufacturers will be on the phone renderings of the black edges P out, be sure to find the time to buy real machine image reference, buy black style is helpless solutions. Yin and Yang work screen, loose buttons, screen / camera there is a gap, off the signal off wifi. The tragedy is that in every domestic manufacturers paste it in similar posts are commonplace. How should I say ...... I can not escape, and wish yourself good luck! High low with oppo vivio has always been high with the low, ""said the phone as long as enough Okay,"" and other brands, cpu detailed configuration of blue-green Plant sometimes even searched the official website only to find vague quad-core eight-core. Of course, this does not affect the glib salesman eighteen cities large kill kill. CPU Qualcomm generally stronger than MediaTek, Samsung's own Orion, Huawei Hass occupied, baseband and gpu reason flagship machine or try to choose high-pass it. MediaTek X20 and X25 running points than Xiaolong 650/652 is much higher, but according to the network reaction, A72 core X20 in addition to basic security Bunny ran timesharing not open, usually ""a hard core has nine nuclear onlookers ""much worse than the actual experience Xiaolong 650/652 for reference only. HTC's first three-male mold body in recent years have been copied to cry, said this figure is released when a shape plus 3 PS spoof users. Many domestic mobile phone production line and even three-quarters of their own design outsourcing to ODM manufacturers, so that when the fan for more bickering Which, totally unaware of these similar phone just with a foundry at each stroke Bale. Millet said bragging own screen from Sharp, bought only to find that domestic Pegasus screen. Meizu said chip MediaTek how big kill four, within two months of the same chip was used in the machine under a thousand grams. 360 Zhou Hongyi, the music, as the PPT Jia Yueting every day on the apple bombers kill out of a thousand times, repeatedly heard the message on foot but also rely on A-share stock price evildoer like standing. Even in those days that he is known as a serious Overheating, but also because a mouthful of promises to open the train is not a fan of court. For a mobile phone manufacturers, the cheapest means of marketing is to attack more heat than their brand, unfortunately, we all know this perfectly well, and employ a large number of navy / navy, he created a pandemonium. I what to buy? Monkey, everyone playing, winning work also see pure character. Avoid the price is low and is not recommended with oppo vivo, it is not recommended hate Overheating hammer, resentment over the wall 360 to report a computer monitor address 360 is not recommended, not like the old-fashioned UI prices artificially high so I do not recommend ZTE Lenovo Cool, so do not do not like to brag recommended as music. If the aim is to support domestic, it chose Huawei bar. Although the price is high, but independent research Huawei Hass chip on the actual experience can really go beyond some of MediaTek, Qualcomm and even race with. This is a great achievement, worthy of support. Respected and effective UI experience, then, the cards red rice millet / Meizu / blue charm has thousand dollars below the 5.5-inch models, the configuration to the home of the old man is simply overkill, let alone well special old model. Want different point, then one plus the oppo own son imitating native android nexus style, you can also try. The future of the domestic mobile phone said so much, we all know, the best user experience from Apple or Samsung's two-class manufacturers. In the global smartphone market, Apple accounted for 91% of the profits while Samsung is 14%, the two together over a hundred mean the rest of the manufacturers and even lose money. Shipments increase only the first step, to build the brand into the high-end market and have to go through years of efforts and the accumulation of reputation. I think of their junior high school, one of the hottest mobile phone is the Nokia N96, but is machine-made shopping advertisement Huaqiang North cottage brick nothing. In high school, it is HTC intelligent machines in the world, each generation has a specific code, G7 is desire, G8 wildfire. Moto has a classic red-eye milestones and three anti-blade, there is said to be able to play Sony PSP games lt26i. A lot of people dream would not have thought, a few years later, when the international big body into hiding eliminate warlords have stood the cusp of the market are those imitators who now broke. Domestic brands have endless groove black point, but this does not affect the basic fact: They use less than half the price, and made hundreds of millions of people can easily afford intelligent machines, fingerprint identification and even these high-end metal body the level dropped synonym thousand Yuan machine. It is not that a few top brands, but the price war in the domestic manufacturers struggling to survive, the majority of people in this country to bring the convenience of the mobile Internet. For this reason I am willing to give a little more patience domestically, more than a few support. You see, God knows a few years, we can make what na.
